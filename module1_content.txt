INTRODUCTION


Before the advent of ubiquitous high-speed internet, streaming services, and TikTok, an interesting experiment was carried out in Ridgewood, New Jersey. At the urging of their teachers, all of the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-grade pupils in one elementary school agreed to swear off television for a week. It was not easy for these children, but apparently most of them stuck with it. One fifth-grader said she cried a lot and sang to keep her mind off television. What surprised teachers, however, were the many complaints they received from parents because their children were pressuring them not to watch television either. Most of the parents absolutely refused. For example, when one ten-year-old girl told her parents she could not eat with them if they watched television during dinner, they told her to eat elsewhere. A mother complained to the school that it was the worst idea they ever had. Her nine-year-old son was pestering her with questions, and it was interfering with her lifestyle. Some parents even tried to sabotage the experiment. One boy reported that his father turned the volume of the television set up extremely high so the youngster could not avoid hearing it.




THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNICATION IN OUR LIVES


That experiment demonstrates clearly the important role of television in the lives of the vast majority of Americans. The adults in Ridgewood are not unintelligent or uncaring. They are well-educated, upper-middle-class suburbanites—people who probably do not perceive, or would not admit to friends, that they are addicted to television. Whether or not they admit it, though, and despite all of their criticisms of the medium, most adults in our society spend a tremendous portion of their lives staring at a screen, and they will not easily give it up.




While streaming video on various devices (from smart TVs to smartphones) is now the dominant form of video consumption, it is not the only medium tightly woven into the fabric of our lives. Many people find newspapers, stereos, books, radio, motion pictures, the internet, or other media equally difficult to stay away from. One study of people’s behavior during a newspaper strike some years ago—prior to the internet—found that many persons were so addicted to newspaper reading that they simply began re-reading old newspapers when new ones were not available.




For more current examples of media addiction, consider studies on social media “detoxes.” Research shows that when people abstain from platforms like Instagram or TikTok, many report feelings of anxiety, boredom, and a compulsive urge to return, highlighting a modern form of media dependence. The “iPad kids” phenomenon is another example. Some children develop signs of addiction such as difficulty with screen time limits, loss of interest in other activities, and meltdowns when screens are taken away.




Media use makes up the vast majority of Americans’ leisure time. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, people spend about five hours a day on leisure, and over three of those hours are spent watching TV alone. When you add in time on social media, gaming, and online videos, media activities account for roughly 80–90% of total leisure time, especially for younger people. Non-media activities like sports, reading, or in-person socializing make up only a small fraction.




Estimates of the time people spend with the mass media depend in part on how you define “spending time with.” However defined, it is a considerable amount of time. Individuals who make little use of the media are extremely rare.

In addition to the 28 hours (about 80%) of leisure time a week spent exclusively with the media, people often attend to media while involved in other activities—such as driving to and from school, eating, cooking, doing housework, or engaging in some other type of work. You have probably listened to music while studying or working around the house, or while traveling to school or work, during meals, at your place of employment, or even while jogging. Television accompanies many of our meals; some of us also watch it on and off while working around the house or taking care of children. Some people read newspapers, magazines, or even novels while they are supposed to be working. And of course, people spend a great deal of time looking at the screens of computers or mobile devices. If these hours of media use during non-leisure time are added to the hours of our leisure devoted to the media, the sum represents a vast portion of our day-to-day lives—more than 13 hours a day.






REVIEW
 — Americans are heavy media consumers. On average, 80 percent of their leisure time is spent with media, and media use accompanies much of their work and other activities. This totals more than 13 hours per day for the average person.

YOUR COMMUNICATION ENVIRONMENT


Have you thought about your particular communication environment, the time you spend with the media, the kinds of face-to-face communication you regularly have, the ways these various forms of communication are interrelated and woven into the fabric of your life and the patterns of that weaving? Is it possible that you would be like the parents in Ridgewood, New Jersey, if your children tried to get you to avoid all television for a week? What if you had to do without your smartphone for a week? Do you know how many of your waking hours are accompanied by some sort of talk and exposure to the media? Do you recognize why you read, hear, or see the things you do? Are you aware of how much of your involvement in communication is the result of conscious selection for some particular purpose, how much of it is habitual, and how much occurs simply because of circumstance: where you are at the moment, who you are with, how available a medium is when you simply want something to occupy your time, or—most important—how your behaviors and perceptions of your world are influenced by your media exposure and other communication? This chapter and those that follow will help you answer these questions.






BYLINE


Estimate the amount of time you spend with each medium of communication on the average day. Then, keep a diary for a few days, trying to follow your normal routine otherwise. In your diary, keep an accurate record of the frequency and amount of time you are exposed to radio, newspapers, television, books, and other media. With this diary record, determine the accuracy of your original estimates.






The Worlds Outside and the World in Your Head


To understand communication, it is useful to keep in mind that you live in four worlds. The first world is simply every bit of information there is to know—for all time and throughout the entire universe. Obviously, most of this information is out of reach for you individually and for humanity as a species. Religious persons who believe in an omniscient God might say that the first world is everything that God knows.




The second world in which you live is a very small subset of the first world and consists of everything around that you could see, hear, or otherwise experience if you chose to do so. It includes the sights outside that you could see if you looked out your window, the stories and advertisements in your newspaper that you could read if you liked, the radio and television material available for you to tune to, the books in your local stores or library that you could obtain without too much difficulty, the conversations going on in your vicinity that you could hear if you wanted to, and a great variety of sights around to which you could direct your eyes.




The third world is a very small subset of your second world, and consists of those available sights, sounds, and other experiences that you attend to or that, somehow, strike your senses. These are the newspaper stories or parts of stories that you decide to read, the movies and television programs you choose to watch or happen to see, your social media activity, the things people around you say that you listen to, and all of the other bits and pieces of information to which you attend at some level of consciousness. To put this another way, the third world in which you live is made up of those parts of your second world that touch you. (Of course, when you choose to do one thing, for example, go to class instead of staying in bed or watching a video, you eliminate all other possibilities available at that time.)




The fourth world is the world in your head. It is a very small subset of the third world. Do you remember everything you perceive? Of course not. Your fourth world is the world you construct from all of the bits and pieces of information and experience that you encountered since you left the womb, if not before. It is a world you are constantly reconstructing as you encounter new bits of information and have other new experiences. Most important, this fourth world is your reality. As a journalist, Walter Lippmann, noted many years ago, in a very real sense, each of us lives in a world that does not exist anywhere except in our heads. It is this world to which we are responding when we vote, express an opinion, or make other decisions. We cannot respond to the world outside, what some would call the “real world”; we can respond only to the world in our heads, for that is the only world, or “reality,” that we know.






REVIEW


Your reality, the world in which you believe, the world to which you respond when you vote or buy, cheer or cry, is the world you constructed in your head. You do not, you cannot, respond directly to the worlds outside your head—your first, second, and third worlds.

War in Your Four Worlds


You might better grasp this idea of the world you construct in your head and the three worlds outside if you think about war, a plague our world has suffered from the dawn of history to the present moment. Although many of us think of wars in relatively simple-minded ways—gun fights between the good guys and the bad guys—wars are extremely complex phenomena. They involve economic, political, social, ethical, and even religious issues. They involve the lives and actions, hopes and despair of a great many individuals, no two of whose stories are exactly the same. These are important aspects of wars, both past and present, that you cannot possibly get all of the information about, even while the wars are going on.




As an illustration, no matter how hard you try, you cannot get all of the facts about the causes of a war. For example, there is no way you can know all of the circumstances surrounding Russia’s decision to invade Ukraine in 2022. It is impossible for you or anyone else to know precisely what was going on inside the heads of leaders like Vladimir Putin, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, or Joe Biden. Neither can we know all of the forces pushing them to act as they did. Nor can you truly know the feelings of all of the Iraqi and Afghani people about those occurrences. Even closer to home, no one except the closest advisers to the presidents knows most of the considerations that went into the decisions sending American troops to the Middle East. This information simply is not available to you, just as many other kinds of relevant information about this or any war are not available. This is part of the world you can never come close to knowing.

On the other hand, there is a great deal of information about these recent wars, or about wars in general, that you could readily encounter by chance or by searching it out, generally from one of the mass media. There is information about wars in various parts of the world reported on television, in newspapers, and in magazines; claims about the right or wrong of American involvement in the Persian Gulf that commentators in the media or perhaps even your friends or other students argue about; news stories in all of the media about the fighting that took place in Kuwait, Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan; facts and opinions about past wars presented in history and political science classes; countless war novels and poems that have been published; the stories of wars from Greek times through at least the Afghanistan and Iraq wars that have been dramatized and are available in print form and, frequently, in the theatre. There are reruns of the famous 1970s and 1980s sitcom “M*A*S*H”, “Band of Brothers” (2001), “Seal Team” (2017) and others that are available frequently on cable, satellite, or streaming,  as well as documentaries about many of the wars in which America has been involved, plus the seemingly innumerable documentaries about Hitler and the Nazis.




The “Beetle Bailey” comic strip—first published in 1950—celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2025 and continues to provide a unique perspective on some of the individuals who fight America’s wars. There are comic books about war. Memes and viral videos shared on platforms like TikTok or Reddit by active-duty service members now provide a real-time, ground-level perspective on military life.




Religious positions on war can be heard on Sunday mornings in many churches and pacifist arguments are available at periodic rallies and peace vigils on almost any college campus. And war songs, from “Yankee Doodle” to the latest country-and-western tune about war and patriotism, are almost impossible to avoid.




It is the rare individual who does not have at least one family member, relative, or friend who served in one of the armed services from whom information could easily be obtained. Among that group may even be someone who, during the days of compulsory military service, faced the decision about whether to accept the military draft or be a conscientious objector.




In short, even though there are some kinds of information about wars or about some particular war that you can never know, a tremendous amount of information is available in what we have called your second world. Authors, publishers, broadcasters, directors, and others who control or work in the media have ensured a more than ample supply of information on almost every conceivable topic. No matter how hard you might try, though, it is impossible to be exposed to all of it. There simply is not enough time or, for most of us, enough energy to grasp as much as might like. None of us can possibly read, listen to, or view more than a minute fraction of what is available.




When you consider that war is only one of an infinite number of issues or stories about which you have a large amount of information in your environment, the impossibility of encountering much of it becomes even clearer. So, by a combination of circumstance and choice, you are exposed to a highly selective sample of the bits of information about war. Over time, this sample has probably become extremely large. Never, though, can you encounter all the information that is available to you on this or any other issue. **Never can you come even close to encountering everything there is to know about the subject. To put this in terms of our analogy of four worlds, never can your third world—the world to which you become exposed—be any more than a small fraction of the second world, all the information about war that could possibly be exposed to, or the first world, the total universe of possible information about war.




In many ways, your fourth world—the world inside your head—is the most interesting of all. That part of the world in your head that is your understanding of war does not have a one-to-one relationship with all of the bits of information about war that you encountered through your lifetime. Although you constructed it from those bits, you interpreted all of them as you took them in, organized them to meet your particular needs and interests, and categorized the result in some particular way. You may have categorized those bits as political issues, ethical or religious issues, issues of patriotism, economic issues, or some combination of these. In addition, you do not remember all the bits of information that you perceived on a particular topic—you forget many of them, so they are no longer a part of the world in your head, although they may have played a part in how you structured this world. In the next chapter “Your Fourth World” we will discuss some of the major factors that caused you to interpret, organize, and categorize that information as you did, that led you to construct that particular world in your head.

The Uniqueness of Your Worlds


We mentioned before that not all people are involved in communication in the same way. The fact is, no two people in the world have precisely the same communication environment or expose themselves to the same bits of their environment. The first world is the same for all of us—that “reality” that consists of everything going on in the world—but our other three worlds differ widely from those of other people. No two people have the opportunity to read precisely the same combination of materials, to talk to the same combination of people, or to hear and see the same combination of movies or radio and television programs. The pattern of selection from that environment is even more heterogeneous. And because we bring such different backgrounds, needs, and interests to the task, the worlds we ultimately create in our heads are different; even those we create from fairly similar experiences are different. As a result, each of us lives in a unique set of worlds.






REVIEW


No two people in the world have exactly the same communication environment, or the same world in their heads.








Think again about the way your understanding of war developed, the way you constructed and reconstructed that part of the world in your head. When did you first encounter information that made you aware of wars? What were all of the sources of information from which you got additional bits of information? Were some of the messages redundant; that is, did you encounter some bits of information a number of times?




Did you see something on television, then read about it in the newspaper, and then hear some of your friends talking about it? For example, just think about all of the situations and sources from which you got information about wars in the Middle East and about other events related to them.






BYLINE


If your memory is good, you should be able to recall a tremendously large number of encounters with bits of information about wars in the Middle East. Can you recall ever changing or refining your understanding of what was happening there? If so, what were the circumstances: What media messages were involved?






Not only have you almost certainly been exposed to many bits of information about the situation in the Middle East; you have probably been involved in conversations about it with friends or family members. During those conversations, you had to respond to questions about some of the issues involved, thus creating additional information for yourself as well as for others about how you perceive those issues. In this way, you developed even firmer views about what was going on. The more you talked about it, the more complete, clear, and unchangeable became this world in your head.




In short, two kinds of things happened as you constructed your understanding of the wars in the Middle East. (1) You were exposed to an ever-increasing number and variety of pieces and sources of information about them. (2) At the same time, you were exposed to a certain amount of repetitiveness, to the same or similar kinds of information again and again. And this process of constructing your understanding of these occurrences is not over; you are likely to continue to receive both new and redundant information for many years to come. Even if all of the problems in the Middle East get settled, novels, television series, film documentaries, poems, exposés, memoirs, and histories will continue to be produced based on these events. Men and women who served in the war will tell and retell stories about it for years to come. As a result, you will continue to reconstruct that part of the world in your head.






REVIEW


On almost any important issue, as time goes on you are exposed to a steadily increasing number and variety of bits of information. In addition, over time, you are exposed to some of the same bits of information many times.






Your Control of Exposure


You may have sought much of the information you have about war, or at least paid attention when it was available. You decided whether to read the newspaper story about national guard or military reserve units from your region called into active duty. You decided whether to watch the television documentary on women at the front or to read Ernest Hemingway’s For Whom the Bell Tolls. And you decided if you should discuss with your friends whether to vote for the candidate for Congress who supported President Obama in sending more troops to Afghanistan. You may even have initiated a discussion in a journalism class about military censorship of news from the front or about the appropriateness of newspapers or television stations showing vivid photographs of the maimed and bloody bodies after a land mine explosion or a bombing. At the minimum, you must have wondered about what factors a responsible editor takes into account in deciding how much space and prominence to give to war coverage and how much to devote to all of the other events in the world. To a great extent, you controlled your exposure to this information and the amount of time you spent thinking and talking about these issues.




Of course, you could not control all of your exposure to information about wars in the Middle East. Sometimes you encountered news about it when you just happened to turn on the television set, although even then you controlled—consciously or unconsciously—the amount of attention you gave it and the parts of the story on which you focused. Nor were you totally in control of the nature of this information; it varied depending on whatever local, state, national, and world events made the war situation more or less newsworthy on any given day.




In any case, you have much greater control of the kinds and amounts of war-related information you are exposed to than most critics of “mass society” give you credit for. If you did not have that control, we would not find such great variation in people’s knowledge and beliefs about war. The image of war that you developed over the years is truly your personal construction.




Not only have your beliefs about war been developed in this way, but also your beliefs about almost everything else—the President, minority groups, nuclear power, the economy, Russia, our educational system, appropriate sex roles, and so forth. All of these parts of your reality—these parts of the world in your head—have been shaped and reshaped by the bits of information and other experiences to which you have been exposed throughout your life.

Think back about your exposure to information the past few days. Other than information related to the courses you are taking this term, what are some of the bits of information to which you were exposed without any effort or intention on your part? What are some of the bits of information you exposed yourself to intentionally? From these examples, can you generalize about the kinds of information exposure over which you have more control and the kinds over which you have less control?

THE FUNCTIONS OF COMMUNICATION MODELS


In the remainder of this chapter, and in other parts of this book, we will be discussing communication models. Because the idea of models may be new to you, it is probably helpful to explain what they are and what they are good for.




Models are abstract descriptions of a phenomenon. Models, or abstract descriptions of communication, for example, help us think about communication more analytically, whether we are (1) trying to solve a specific, immediate problem-such as assessing the effectiveness of a particular advertisement so we can decide whether to use it, or (2) developing and testing a theory that can help us solve a wider range of problems. For either of these purposes, we always need to have some image, picture, blueprint, or “model” of how the phenomenon works. For the study of communication or the solving of a communication problem, we need a communication model.




Models can help us perceive things we would not otherwise have perceived or thought of. They can also help us organize our ideas about the phenomenon. They facilitate our thinking beyond the specific instances of communication that are before us so that we can consider more general problems. Conversely, they can help us understand a particular problem by stripping away the immediate context so we can get down to fundamentals. The fact that a model is an abstract description helps us do that. It strips away the elements that are tied to specific instances.




It is this abstract quality of models that bothers some people. They say that no model describes communication in all its richness, that the model is different from the instances they know about. And they are perfectly right. No model describes everything about communication. In this sense, models are like any other kind of description, including verbal descriptions. When we use words to describe your college or class, when we describe you, or when we describe communication with words, our description is an abstraction. It is not the thing itself.




All of the sciences use models and all encounter some of the same criticisms of them. You may have encountered models of molecules in a chemistry class or a model of the solar system in an astronomy class. The explanation of models by a philosopher of science named Hesse (1966) may clarify our point about the differences between a model and the phenomenon it helps us to understand:






When we take a collection of billiard balls in random motion as a model for a gas, we are not asserting that billiard balls are in all respects like gas particles, for billiard balls are red and white, and hard and shiny, and we are not intending to suggest that gas molecules have these properties. We are in fact saying that gas molecules are analogous to billiard balls, and the relation of analogy means that there are some properties of billiard balls which are not found in molecules [negative analogies] and there are some which are [positive analogies] . . . . Now the important thing about this kind of model-thinking in the sciences (and social sciences) is that there will generally be some properties of the model about which we do not yet know whether they are positive or negative analogies; these are the interesting properties, because . . . they allow us to make new predictions . [These are the uncertain analogies.]


M. B. Hesse, Models and Analogies in Science (Notre Dame: University of
Notre Dame Press, 1966), p. 8.








REVIEW


A model is an abstract description of a phenomenon that helps us (a) think about the phenomenon in new ways, (b) perceive some aspects of the phenomenon we would not otherwise have thought of, (c) organize our ideas about the phenomenon, and (d) make new predictions about the phenomenon that we can then test.






Let us give you another example, the example of the floor plan of a house. In a sense, a model has the same relationship to the phenomenon it is describing as a floor plan does to the structure on which it is based. A floor plan is clearly different from the house, and yet it often helps us to see the house in fresh and useful ways.




Just as a floor plan is but one way of conceiving of a particular house, or perhaps of the general concept “house,” so a model is just one way of conceiving of a particular phenomenon or concept. The criterion for judging a floor plan is whether it is useful or whether it stimulates you to think of fresh ideas about how to decorate the house or how to use the rooms.




That is also true of the scientific model. Like the floor plan, in assessing scientific models we are primarily concerned with utility. Is the model useful? Does it help us perceive some aspects of communication that we would not have perceived without it? Does it help guide our study of communication in useful ways? Are there some properties or aspects of the model whose relationship to the phenomenon we are unsure about—we do not know whether they are analogous to our phenomenon or not? Models with such properties are especially useful for scholars because, as Hesse pointed out, we can get new hypotheses from them-new ideas for testing.




So far, our discussion of models has been rather abstract and perhaps confusing. Any confusion should be cleared up, though, as we look at some models of communication and discuss their utility.






BYLINE


Before turning to the communication models, review what you have learned about models in general. How would you define a model in your own words? What is a “negative analogy”? A "positive analogy’'?

SOME TRADITIONAL MODELS OF COMMUNICATION


If you are like most people, you usually think about communication as receiving information or messages from the mass media or other people or sending information or messages to others. It is like pouring lemonade from one person’s pitcher into another person’s glass, the pouring of meaning from one head into another—like a file transfer, where information is copied perfectly from a server to a computer.




Communication scholars have depicted this view of communication in a source-message-receiver model (SMR), or if they were concerned with mass communication, in a source-message-channel-receiver (SMCR) model.






This model suggests that a source sends a message through some channel to a receiver who absorbs it in just the way in which it was sent, unless the receiver is inattentive. In general, the source or sender is in control of what the receiver learns. In much the same way, you may have envisioned mass communication as simply the pouring or transmission of the same meanings into the heads of a large number of anonymous, isolated, and passive individuals—“the masses”—as in Figure 1.3. But this model grossly distorts the great differences among individuals in patterns of exposure and ways of processing the information they receive. The vast majority of people may be anonymous, as far as mass communicators are concerned, but they are neither isolated nor passive.






Bruce Westley and Malcolm MacLean (1957), two communication scholars disturbed by the oversimplification of existing models of mass communication, developed a more elaborate model. It stresses that much of what we get from the mass media, before it ever reaches us, has been shaped by a variety of individuals, institutions, and technologies. An adaptation of their model can be seen in Figure 1.4.






The Westley-MacLean model points up the fact that, in any form of mass communication, information goes through a series of gatekeepers, labeled in our adaptation of the model, observers/interpreters/translators. A reporter, for example, is an observer/interpreter/translator. A military censor is a different type of observer/interpreter/translator. The editor who decides whether the reporter’s translation of an event will be used observes and interprets not only the reporter’s copy, but also other related information. The editor may even have been exposed first-hand to the event being reported. If the decision is positive, the editor translates the information again through editing. If such a situation involves a large newspaper, someone else on the staff observes and interprets the information to decide on which page it will go and how prominently it will be displayed, a process that is also a type of translation. The headline writer also observes and interprets this version of the story and translates it further by deciding on the kind and size of headline. If such a scenario involves a radio or television newscast, the on-air reporter or anchor provides yet another translation by deciding on the placement of the story within the newscast, by choosing the visuals to accompany it, by deciding whether to use the original reporter’s voice-on-tape or to substitute the anchor’s voice, and, if the latter, by choosing the tone of voice with which to present the copy on the air.




Still another type of observer/interpreter/translator is the technology used. That technology is as much a gatekeeper as an editor is; a story reported with a video camera can never be precisely the same as a story reported with just a laptop word processor.




Even the readers, viewers, or listeners are not only observers and interpreters but, quite often, translators as well, because they put the information into yet another form as they talk about it with friends and family members, or when they write or call a station or newspaper to compliment or complain about it.




The Westley-Maclean model takes into account that response of audience members as it points up the fact that communication goes in more than one direction: receivers often provide feedback to the original sources, responses or reactions to the sources’ messages, which can cause the sources, consciously or unconsciously, to alter their communicative behavior. Journalists not only send stories to their editors, they get reactions back, just as editors get reactions from readers or viewers. There are few, if any, people involved in mass communication who do not get feedback in one form or another.




In addition, just as readers or viewers are influenced by what they read and see, media people are influenced by this feedback. What they select to transmit, the way they shape that material, and even the way they perceive it are influenced by this feedback. One of the important contributions of the Westley-Maclean model is to remind us that communication is a continuing, multidirectional process.

THE MOSAIC MODEL OF COMMUNICATION


Although each of these models of mass communication provides insight into some aspect of communication processes, none gives us an adequate picture of the contemporary world of communication that you and others experience. Nor do these provide any insight into our role—the role of audience members—in the communication process. The mosaic model overcomes those deficiencies.




We call this a mosaic model because the communication environment in which all of us live—what we labeled our “second world” earlier in this chapter—is like a vast mosaic of information bits. Readily available to all of us at virtually any time are newspapers, books, magazines, television, radio, motion pictures, recordings, pamphlets, and other people. Each of these is a source of countless bits of information on almost an infinite variety of topics. From this vast mosaic of information bits in our environment, we select or are exposed to a limited number. These comprise what we earlier called our “third world.” And it is from this limited number of bits of information that we construct our “fourth world”—that world in our heads.




Representing the Communication Mosaic Visually


In visualizing the communication mosaic model, think first about just one topic, perhaps the topic of war we discussed earlier. Consider all of the possible sources of information on this topic to which you might turn and the vast number of possible bits of information available in those sources. We can picture those sources and information bits as a matrix of squares, like the matrix shown in Figure 1.5. Each row stands for one of the almost infinite number of sources you have available, if you choose to use them. Some of these are newspapers, others are television channels, books, persons, and so forth. Each column stands for one of the available bits of information about war that might be found through those sources. Some of those bits of information are available from many sources; others are available from only one or two. At times, there are probably some bits not available from any source.






REVIEW


The mosaic model is an abstract description of your environment. This environment is like a vast mosaic composed of all the bits of information available to you from a great variety of sources. You are exposed to, or attend to, only a tiny fraction of what is available. From this relatively small sample, you construct—and constantly reconstruct—the world in your head.






For almost any topic, there are many bits of information available from a number of different sources. 


You will notice that some of the squares are colored in, while most are not. The filled-in squares represent those few bits of information you attend to or happen to notice and the sources in which you encounter them—if we are thinking about your third world—but, we do not remember everything that we are exposed to, so the filled-in squares could also be thought of as all the bits of information that we remember—our fourth world. As you can see, in either case only a small number of the squares are filled in. This indicates that you, or any of us, encounter only a small fraction of the great number of the bits of information about war that are available in our environment, and we remember an even smaller fraction.




Some of these bits are those you looked for; others are those you encountered by accident, perhaps hearing them when some friend or family member turned on the radio. Thus, there is a certain amount of chance or randomness in the information about war that you encounter. It is not totally a matter of chance, of course. If you are a member of the National Guard or of the reserves, you are almost certain to encounter more bits of information about war than if you are not. If you have friends or family members who are in the service or who are active in either the ROTC or some pacifist group, you are almost certain to hear more about the issue than if your friends and family are indifferent to it. If you live in an area where there is a large military base you are almost certain to run into more information on the topic than people who live in other areas.

Try to list all of the sources from which you have ever gotten any bits of information about wars in the Middle East, both media and interpersonal sources. Rank them in terms of the relative amounts of information you have received from each. Is that rank order the same as or different than what it would be for other types of issues, such as the issue of tuition increases? How do you explain the similarity or difference?






The interaction of sources.


Some media, such as television and the motion picture, are each multiple sources. We simultaneously get both aural and visual information from each. These aural and visual “tracks” interact, just as the various images or bits of information that we get from completely different sources interact as we use them to create our meanings. By interaction we mean they affect each other; the meaning you construct from a visual image will be different when it is accompanied by different sounds, just as your interpretation of different sounds will be different when accompanied by different visual images. For example, assume that you are watching a story on television about yet another possible war in the Middle East. While the anchor person is reading the story, the producer could insert many different kinds of visual images: starving refugee children, soldiers in the desert, burning tanks, bombed-out buildings, wounded in a hospital, or diplomats arguing about the issue at the United Nations. The same words accompanied by each of these different kinds of pictures would tend to lead viewers to construct completely different meanings for the story of the new military threat because the viewers would be associating quite different kinds of information with the bits of information about the threat.




Interaction can also occur between or among independent sources. The sources may be concurrent, or involve your short- or long-term memory. In either case, the meaning you construct from one source can be affected by another.




Not only does interaction occur among sources for individual topics, but sources and bits of information for different topics also interact. For example, in Texas there is a category of jokes, "Aggie jokes," depending on an offensive stereotype that links the "Texas A&M" and "stupid people" mosaics.


You have information on many topics.


To this point, we talked about the interaction among sources of information relevant to your image of war: bits of information about war that you sense in the present, and the picture of war that you constructed in the past and now have stored in memory. To better understand why you have constructed your particular meaning or understanding of war, you must take into account at least one other factor. Every time you encounter or remember anything about war, your interpretation of it will be affected by the other issues or topics about which you are getting information.




For example, your interpretation of new information regarding the issue of war might be shaped by information you are getting at roughly the same time on world hunger, the dependence of our country on oil, progress on achieving equal rights for women, the poor treatment of political dissidents in many countries, the inefficiency of government agencies, the corruption among government officials in many countries that are our allies, or any number of other topics. These other messages form a context for your construction of the meaning of war.




In fact, these other messages can increase or decrease the level of attention you give to news about war. If a major story grabs your attention, such as a story about the threat of a major economic recession, you are more likely to ignore completely any story about war or the threat of war. On the other hand, if the major story of the day is focused on all of the political abuses being practiced in a country we oppose, or on ways in which that country is getting a stranglehold on our economy through its control of oil prices, you will probably give more attention to the story about the war than you would otherwise.




These different topics for which sources and bits of information are available in our environment form the third dimension of our communication mosaic. This can be visualized as a series of index cards, like those library patrons used to use to find the books they wanted. There is a mosaic (or “card”) for each topic or idea you have information about. Each mosaic is a two-dimensional representation of sources and information bits.








REVIEW


Your communication mosaic is constantly changing. And the bits of information to which you were exposed in the past interact with those to which you are exposed now, just as the sights and sounds you sense simultaneously interact.






The fourth dimension of the mosaic: time and memory.


Your communication mosaic is constantly changing. The sources and bits of information available to you keep changing and, from what is available, the sources and bits that come to your attention also keep changing.




For example, the information available on radio, television, or from other people changes steadily. If you do not hear what newscasters are saying as they say it, you cannot ordinarily have it repeated, although you may hear it again on a later newscast. The newscasters, like your friends, move on from one topic to another. Other media, such as newspapers, do not change as steadily, but each day a new newspaper appears, and the old one is used to wrap the garbage or is recycled, thus disappearing from your environment.




Another source of change in your communication environment over time is your movement from place to place. Clearly, when you leave your home and go to class, or when you go from class to work, or even when you move from one friend or group of friends to another, the sources and kinds of information available to you change quite substantially, as do the sources and kinds of information to which you attend.




Thus, over time, you are exposed to a great variety of different sources and bits of information. Insofar as the time dimension affects the construction and reconstruction of that world in your head, it is analogous to your memory. New information that you encounter can often stir that memory and make vivid in your mind some information or event that you experienced long ago and have not thought of for a long time. There can even be an interaction between the present and past experience that leads you to see the past in a totally new way. For example, you may once have had a negative view of a friend you knew in high school who enlisted in the military when he or she graduated. All of the recent information about American soldiers defending our interests in the Middle East, however, has led you to see this friend in a vastly different light. Conversely, your memory of this friend affects your perception of the new information you are getting about soldiers in the Middle East or, if the friend is female, for example, about whether women should serve in combat units.




This interaction of present and past helps to explain why different people often construct quite different meanings or interpretations from the same bit of information they encounter. A large group of us might watch the same situation comedy about a family in which the son or daughter enlists in the Marines or the Army. Each of us will “understand” that young man or woman and the program in a somewhat different way because our prior relevant experiences have been different, and so the relevant meanings in that world in our heads that we use to make sense of the program are different.




Another important effect of time is its tendency to make our perceptions of issues, events, and people increasingly complex and yet increasingly clear. As we encounter more and more bits of information about war in general, or about the Persian Gulf situation in particular, our picture of it tends to become clearer. At the same time, however it becomes more complex; we see many aspects of war that we never thought about before.




Still another way to think of time or memory is as one additional source to which you turn for information. Just as you search a newspaper for some bit of information you want, you sometimes search your memory also. In addition, just as you sometimes happen to encounter some relevant bit of information on television just by chance, so you can suddenly recall some relevant bit of information from memory just by chance—probably stimulated by something in the present.




In a way, your memory—all of the nooks and crannies of that world in your head—is like a library packed with your history. An even better analogy might be the old-time general store that you have probably seen depicted in some television show, encountered in old movies, or read about in histories of America. The general store had everything in it that the owner-manager had ever come across: brooms, books and baseball bats, meats and matches, tables and tobacco, nails and netting, spices and suspenders, apples and aspirin, gasoline, garden hoses and galoshes, pickles, and powder puffs.




Sometimes you forget what is stocked in that old-time general store that is your memory until something happens that reminds you, or you stumble across it while searching for something else. On the other hand, you are almost always aware of the items in your storehouse that many customers are interested in, and you can pull them out of their bin with hardly a thought. So it is with items in memory that you need to recall often.

Your memory may be one of the most fully packed sources of information to which you turn for information to supplement or help you understand material from other sources.

Define the communication mosaic in your own words. What are the four dimensions of this model? How does the mosaic model relate to the four worlds that we discussed in the early part of this chapter?






The Value of the Mosaic Model


Everyone is operating with partial information.


As noted earlier,  you are exposed to, or attend to, only a tiny fraction of the information bits that are available on any topic. From this relatively small sample, you construct—and constantly reconstruct—the world in your head. This is true for everyone. No one has complete information, but that does not keep us from having “whole” ideas, attitudes, opinions, and all the other things that go into having an understanding of the world in our head—being limited to partial information does not prevent us from making decisions, taking action, and in other ways operating in the real world. Traditional communication models ignore this aspect of our communication environment. The mosaic model makes it a key feature in its visualization of this environment.




Receivers versus participants.


Although each of the models of communication presented in the early part of this chapter provides insight into some aspect of communication processes, none gives us insight into the role of people such as ourselves, who depend on the mass media and on other people for most of our information. Most of these models seem to picture us as passive sponges, soaking up whatever messages the media send our way and soaking them up in exactly the way in which they are sent. In fact, as we indicated with the example of the war, we are far from passive. Neither the simple source-message-channel-receiver model, the transfer-of-meaning model, the source-message-channel-many-receivers model, or even the feedback model of Westley and Maclean adequately describes our role in communication processes or the way in which any of us experience mass communication. The mosaic model better fits our real-life communication. It takes into account the various kinds of communication in which we engage, the close relationship of mass communication and interpersonal communication, and the active role you play in this process.




First of all, the mosaic model is based on a very different conception of communication than that underlying all of the other models. Each of those earlier models we talked about suggests that the important people in communication are the sources. They are in the driver’s seat; they control the communication process. The mosaic model, on the other hand, suggests that the important people in communication—the people in the driver’s seat—are the audience members, those to whom communication is being directed. Given this mosaic conception of communication, it is a mistake to think of anyone as a mere “receiver” of information. It is far more valid to think of yourself and others as participants.




To put this another way, those other models define communication in terms of someone sending messages to someone else. The mosaic model defines communication in terms of you, or ourselves, or anyone else constructing our own messages from the words, pictures, objects, odors, or actions that we encounter in our environment.






REVIEW


You are never simply a receiver of communication; you are always a participant in the communication process because you select much of the information to which you are exposed and you construct meanings from it.






The Construction of Meaning


There are two key concepts to consider when you think about communication in this way. One is construction. We do not receive messages; we construct messages. No one can pour messages into our heads; we create the messages in our own heads.




The second key term is meaning. An important implication of the mosaic model is that meanings are not in words or news stories, television programs or photographs; meanings are in people. You interpret the words or stories, programs, or photographs; this is simply a different way of saying that you construct meanings from them.






BYLINE


What do we mean when we say that meanings are not in words or pictures, newspapers or television programs, but that meanings are in people?






Not only do you construct meanings from the bits of information or stimuli you encounter in the mass media and elsewhere; you constantly reconstruct those meanings as you encounter new bits of information or as your needs or experiences change. Few if any of your meanings were constructed on the basis of information from a single message in isolation. Any one news story conversation, motion picture, radio program, or television program was but a small part of the information that you have received about war in the Middle East. As a result, any one of these stories, by itself, had only a small impact on that world in your head.




Reconstructions of meaning.


On the other hand, over time, as you continue to get information from these various sources, you regularly reassess and refine your meanings. Once in a while, you even revise some of them quite drastically, especially when you get a flood of information from a variety of sources about some new development. Thus, for example, what “war” means to you, that part of the world in your head that is your understanding of what war is like, is constantly evolving. When war in the Middle East breaks out and there is a heavy flow of news about it in most of the media you use, and people around you talk a great deal about it, you must reconstruct your understanding, or meaning, of war quite substantially, as well as your meanings for Israel, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and other countries in that part of the world.




There is a term used by some contemporary artists that describes this continual construction and reconstruction of our meanings quite well. It is cumulative meanings. By this we mean that your beliefs about the world are based on bits of information and experiences that you accumulated over time. Thus, your meanings for most of the important events, people, and ideas in the world are not static, they evolve as you experience or accumulate bits of relevant information.




Communication scholar Wilbur Schramm likened this process to the gradual building up of a stalagmite in a cave. A stalagmite is formed by the constant drip of calcareous water upon it, each drop leaving a residue so small as to be invisible until the dripping has continued for hundreds of years. In the same way, except in extremely unusual cases, any one bit of information about war—or anything else—has only an imperceptible effect on that world in your head. Although it does not take hundreds of years for recognizable change to occur in that world in your head, it generally takes a fair amount of time and many bits of information.




Or we can think of it like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine-learning. An AI model is fed countless bits of data (like photos of cats). Each individual photo has a minuscule effect, but over millions of examples, the AI gradually constructs a complex and refined “understanding” of what a cat is.




The particular bits of information that are relevant to the construction and constant reconstruction of your meanings are not always obvious. Your meaning of war and peace, and whether any particular war was justifiable, may be shaped by what you know about the people of other countries and cultures, about politics and economics, psychology and nuclear science, and about the many wars that have affected this world. Your religious beliefs may also strongly influence your views of war, as will your friends’ and family members’ beliefs about war.






BYLINE


Why is the idea of “cumulative meanings” particularly apt for describing your beliefs about the world, for describing the world in your head? Does it fit your recollection of how you constructed your message of wars in the Middle East?






A broadened conception of information.


Some of those bits of information that you use in constructing your fourth world, that world in your head, may not even be “information” in the usual sense of that term. They may come from comic strips, novels, situation comedies, or other experiences we think of as entertainment. For example, when a television soap opera character is considering enlisting in the army in order to help defend his or her country and discusses the matter with family and friends, some of whom favor the idea and some of whom oppose it, how do those bits of information differ in your use of them from the bits of information you encounter in the news? Research evidence indicates that they differ little, if at all.




You are probably constructing your meanings for law officers and the kinds of crime that go on in large cities at least as much from police and private eye shows on television as you are from news stories and personal observation.




The point of all this is that the differences between entertainment content in the media and news or information content is not nearly as important as most people believe, at least not when we are trying to explain how and why people construct the worlds in their heads that they do. It is an error to assume that a television series about crime and police work is merely entertainment, while only newspaper stories about crime and police work are “news.” Programs such as “60 Minutes” or a situation comedy, cartoons, novels and motion pictures, and the lyrics of popular music all provide bits of information that we use to construct the world in our heads.

Paths through the mosaic.


As you look at the representation of the mosaic, visualize a person moving through their lives—that is, through space and time—with the available bits of information changing as they do so, and paying attention to some bits, but not others. You move through your communication environment in just this way, encountering some information in some sources on some topics and missing other information that is there. Obviously, no two people go through their environments in precisely the same way; no two people encounter or attend to all of the same bits of information.




In addition, you, like others, go through your mosaic in different ways at different times. Sometimes you rush madly through, with your mind on other things, and so avoid or hardly notice any of the new information available to you. At other times, you move more slowly, studying the bits of information carefully, turning from one source of information to another in order to build as complete and valid a picture as possible of some event, person, or issue. At still other times you are relatively passive, neither seeking nor avoiding information, just noticing the information that happens to cross your path.




The particular path you take through the mosaic affects not only which bits of information you encounter, but also the context for each bit—what comes before and after it. As we indicated earlier, that context can affect your interpretation of the information almost as much as the information itself does. We will talk more about the influence of context on meaning construction, as well as other influences on that construction, in Your Fourth World.

Think about the way you use the media. Are there particular patterns in your use? For example, do you usually read a daily newspaper before or after hearing a radio or television newscast (assuming that you do both)? When you read a newspaper, what “path” through the paper do you usually follow? Do you start at page 1 and read straight through the paper, or do you read it in a different order? Does the way you read the paper increase or decrease the probability of your noticing certain kinds of items in the paper?






Gaps in the mosaic.


From our discussion so far, it should be clear that all of us have gaps in the information to which we have been exposed, important information about a topic that was not in any of the messages we received, or information that we did not notice. No individual is probably ever exposed to all possible information about a topic. At the same time, all of us have within ourselves a need for order, for wholeness, for seeing the complete picture. Therefore, we fill those gaps, usually without even being aware that we are doing so.




Imagine, for example, that you see four photographs in succession. The first shows a child glaring at another child. The second shows a small child’s fist. The third has that fist against the nose of the second child. And the fourth shows that second child lying on the floor with tears streaming from both eyes. Before going on, think about those photographs and the message you constructed from them. If you are like other people, you filled in the gaps between those photographs. You “saw” the fist being formed, then being swung through the air, and the child falling. You might even have “heard” the second child falling. Again, stop for a moment here and, before reading on, picture that scene. Can you get an image of it in your mind? Can you see those children? Quickly: Are they boys or girls?




Given the worlds in the heads of most of us, constructed from images encountered in children’s books, television, and elsewhere, you probably “saw” that both of those children were boys. Nothing in the description of the photographs mentioned their sex. That was a gap in the set of information given to you. In creating your world, in constructing the “reality” of that fight in your head, you filled that gap, along with all of the others that were there. In the same way and for the same reasons, you fill the gaps in the messages you encounter about war, crack and cocaine, the abortion issue, your friends and enemies, China, the dangers of tobacco and alcohol, the President of the United States, intercollegiate athletics, and all of the other ideas or topics that are important to you and about which you get bits of information from the mosaic that is your environment.




Unintended bits of information.


Because most of us do not read, hear, or see every bit of information in the messages contained in the media or in the conversations of our friends, we are not aware of all of the meanings intended by the message creators. On the other hand, we often get some unintended bits of information from their messages. That is, we notice some bits of information in a message that the source did not consider or plan to have there. Almost any motion picture, television or radio Program, magazine article, or newspaper story that is intended to communicate information about some particular subject also communicates information about a host of other topics to some receivers.




Those unintended bits of information may be present because of the content of the message (the “thing” a creator is telling us about), the background or setting, or perhaps even the medium itself. For example, a magazine photograph of Serena Williams making the winning tennis shot for the deciding match in the U.S. Open carries innumerable elements that are irrelevant to the intended message—that this was her fifth U.S. Open title—but that are necessary to include. Williams’ tennis outfit has no necessary relationship to the intended message but, in visual media at least, must be included, and some viewers will use it in their construction, or reconstruction, of the message of tennis fashions in their heads. Serena Williams herself might also fit into various messages in people’s heads, in addition to the one intended by the publication of the photograph. She might fit into a message about athletes, tennis, America’s standing in world tennis, sportsmanship, and the integration of African-Americans into our society. Information bits in that photograph could affect our meanings for any or all of those messages. Some who see the photograph may not even notice that it has anything to do with the U.S. Open, nor will they catch the player’s name; the message for them will be one about the photographer’s skill and perhaps even about the art of photography itself. In later chapters we will talk about some of the factors that cause different people to “read” photographs, motion pictures, television programs, news stories, or books in such different ways.






FACT OR FICTION


An artist once was walking through a museum when she saw a well-dressed young man examining one of her paintings. It was a highly abstract work titled simply Man. The museum patron first stood far back and stared at the painting. Then he got up close, studying it from side to side and top to bottom, very much in the style of a true connoisseur of art. Then he moved back to study it in its entirety again. Finally he shrugged his shoulders and growled, “Humph, that’s not a man!” At this, the artist could contain herself no longer. She tapped him on the shoulder and said, “You are right, my dear fellow, that is not a man. You are a man. That is a painting.”




Much the same can be said about the images in your head. They are not the things in the world outside. Like works of art, they are your representations of those things. In a sense, that world in your head—everything you know—is a construction, a fiction.




Reality: fact or fiction?


That may seem too far-fetched a statement to you, but let us examine it for a moment. If you are like most people, you are, pretty certain you know what a fact is. You have no hesitation in calling some things “fact” and other things “fiction.” Stories that an author makes up and descriptions that are inconsistent with your observations you label “fiction,” while your account of what you observe, the accounts of others that are consistent with your observations, and the accounts of others whom you trust you label “fact.” Fortunately or unfortunately, the world is not that simple. If it were, all of us—you and your parents, your teachers and the local garbage collectors, people in this country, in Iran, and Russia—would see the world in much more similar ways than we do. The fact is that every observation, even yours, is a perception, an interpretation of an experience—an interpretation based only in part on that experience and in part on the context of that experience and memory of other experiences. In other words, it is a fiction.




If this claim is hard for you to believe, think again about our story of the man and the painting. No painting of a man is a man. Not even a photograph truly captures the “real” man. It is merely a representation of a man, or of men in general. It is something constructed by the photographer, the camera, and the developer. Obviously, a photograph is affected by the appearance of the object at the moment the shutter is clicked, but that appearance is just one of the factors affecting the final picture.




General semanticists, scholars who study the way people use language in everyday life, have a favorite saying: “The word is not the thing.” In the same way, photographs of objects, accounts of events, descriptions of people, or explanations of ideas are not the objects, events, people, or ideas. They are constructions. Thus, the images, accounts, descriptions, and explanations in your head of everything you believe you know are constructions. They are fictions you created that represent some parts of the world around you.






REVIEW


Perception is the meaning you construct of something. It is an interpretation of present experiences based, in part, on what you sense through your eyes, ears, nose, and skin, in part on the context of those experiences, and in part on your memory of related experiences in the past. Your perception is what you believe you have seen, heard, or felt.






All of us, to varying degrees, construct different meanings for what seem to be the same phenomena, even when we have been exposed to those phenomena in roughly the same way. Whether or not you accept that generalization, why do you suppose it might be so? Why do people construct different worlds in their heads about chemical warfare, the Middle East, student government, professional football, our president, and the many other people, events, and places about which they observe bits of information directly or through the media? This chapter provides some answers to these questions. These answers, in turn, should help you understand and, to some extent at least, control the way you see your world—the way you construct that world in your head.

NEGOTIATING OUR MEDIA MOSAICS CONCEPTUALLY


In the first half of this chapter we talked about the ways in which individuals physically negotiate their communication environments, exposing themselves more to those media, people, and content that best fit then needs, wants, and styles of life. Now we will discuss the ways in which people negotiate their communication environments perceptually, in ways that fit their personal limitations and needs.




To understand communication, you must recognize that there are differences between your perception—what you believe you have seen, heard, or felt—and what is truly there. Perception is a creative process. It is not simply observing, hearing, or sensing what is out there in your environment. It also involves assigning meaning to those stimuli. In fact, what you experience is more a product of your interpretations of information than of the information itself. For example, there is strong evidence that the physiological states associated with being frightened, angered, or pleasantly excited are almost, if not completely, identical. Whether you experience fear, anger, or excitement depends on your interpretation of those physical states. For example, if you are watching a movie and feel your heart beating faster, you decide whether you are frightened, pleasantly excited, or angry on the basis of whether you are seeing a chase scene or a love scene, or hearing the people behind you loudly talking and munching on strong-smelling popcorn. In all three cases, your physiological response (increased heart rate, blood pressure, and so on) is the same. But the way you interpret that response depends on the context or external cues you use to label the emotional state associated with it.




In the same way, as the media or other sources stimulate our senses, we interpret those sensations, in part, by associating them with bits of information in memory. Using patterns we have developed over time, we invent a reality and then constantly reinvent it or reshape it as we encounter additional fragments of information. This sort of invention, or the construction and reconstruction of our realities, is something each of us does all of the time in his or her role as receiver. These “pictures in our heads” are important because they represent our perceptions of reality. And, as Walter Lippmann pointed out, even if these pictures are inaccurate, we behave as if they were true. We react not to what is true but to what we perceive to be true.




Lippmann’s example, described in his famous book on public opinion, is the group of Germans, French, and British who were living on an isolated island when World War I broke out among their countries. It was over six weeks before the islanders discovered they were at war with each other. As Lippmann put it:






For over six weeks now those of them who were English and those of them who were French had been fighting . . . those of them who were Germans. For six strange weeks they had acted as if they were friends, when in fact they were enemies.

SCRIPTS/SCHEMATA: AIDS TO PERCEPTION


Communication scholars refer to those patterns we have developed over time as scripts or schemata. More specifically, scripts, or schemata, are stereotyped sequences of events in memory that are activated by observations or experiences in the present. They are important because they help us organize incoming information so that we can understand it. Put another way, a script gives you a framework for constructing or assigning meaning to new information. Scripts also affect your expectations about the order of events or parts of an event and lead you to fill in missing parts in a particular way. For example, when you read in a novel or newspaper about a character entering a restaurant, your “restaurant going script” is activated, and you automatically fill in missing information: being seated at a table or counter, studying the menu, ordering, being served by the waiter, calculating the tip, paying your bill, and soon.






Scripts provide interpretive frameworks for media material that might otherwise be difficult to understand. The following paragraph beautifully illustrates this phenomenon:






With hocked gems financing him, our hero bravely defied all scornful laughter that tried to prevent his scheme. Your eyes deceive, he had said. An egg, not a table, correctly typifies this unexplored planet. Now three sturdy sisters sought proof. Forging along sometimes through calm vastness, yet more often over turbulent peaks and valleys, days became weeks. As many doubters spread fearful rumors about the edge, at last, from nowhere, welcome winged creatures appeared signifying momentous success.






Can you make sense of this paragraph? Do the sentences seem to have any relationship to each other? What does it all mean? After thinking about that for a while, read it again, this time with the knowledge that the paragraph comes from a story titled “Christopher Columbus Discovering America.” Unless your mind works in very different ways from most people’s, that title will activate your “Christopher Columbus script,” and you will find it easy to interpret the paragraph within that framework. Not only will you now be more certain that you understand it, you will find that it takes less effort to read.




In The Guardian TV commercial below, most viewers predictably activate a different script for each of the three shots, and you can be sure the creators of the commercial knew this when they developed the idea.






It may help you understand the way you use the scripts in your head to cope with and interpret experiences if you think of a reporter covering a three-alarm fire or a meeting of the local city council. Exposure to one of those events activates the reporter’s “fire script” or “city council script,” and the story that results is heavily influenced by the set of expectations that script generates, as well as by the events that occur at the fire or meeting. (We will return to this point in the Professional Norms and Practices chapter as we talk about the norms of journalists.)






REVIEW


Scripts or schemata are patterns or frameworks that we develop on the basis of past experiences. We use them to help us interpret similar experiences in the present.






Maintaining and Adjusting Our Realities


The scripts or pictures of the world in our heads, our realities, have been shaped by our particular experiences, knowledge, needs, values, and beliefs. And they are constantly tested against new fragments of information we sense from our environment. Sometimes these new fragments simply reinforce an existing script. At other times they make the script clearer, add a new element to it, or force a restructuring of it. In these ways, the bits of information we are continually sensing from our communication mosaics cause us to maintain, strengthen, or revise those scripts or pictures in our heads.




For example, you have some sort of image or script about Hollywood in your head. Each time you encounter some mention of Hollywood in one of the media, that script is likely to be activated and to aid your interpretation of what you are reading, seeing, or hearing. As you encounter new fragments of information about Hollywood from your communication environment, those fragments have meaning for you only insofar as they fit with the pattern or script in your head that is your prior image of that West Coast wonderland. You may not comprehend a discussion of Hollywood’s history unless you have already acquired meanings for such concepts as the Trust, vertical integration, or four-walling (all terms that are defined in the Motion Pictures chapter).




This explains why many communicators claim you cannot tell people anything they do not already know. On the face of it, that seems a rather extreme and pessimistic statement, especially for those of us concerned with helping the public become better informed or better educated. But it is more true than false. Neither you nor any member of the mass media audience can perceive or understand anything you cannot relate in some way to your prior experience—that you cannot fit in some way into one of the scripts or realities in your head. In addition, once you process these new fragments of information that fit your script or prior image of the object or idea, these new fragments in turn reshape that image or script.




You probably have difficulty accepting that generalization, especially when you think of your visual experiences. Surely, what you see is what is there—at least most of the time. Most likely, you are confident that you can perceive objects you have not seen before, or that you have no meaning for. Surprisingly, though, this is not the case. Testimony in support of that conclusion comes from biologist John Young:






The visual receiving system in its untrained state has only very limited powers. We are perhaps deceived by the fact that the eye is a sort of camera. Contrary to what we might suppose, the eyes and brain do not simply record in a sort of photographic manner the pictures that pass in front of us. The brain is not by any means a simple recording system like a film. . . . Many of our affairs are conducted on the assumption that our sense organs provide us with an accurate record, independent of ourselves. What we are now beginning to realize is that much of this is an illusion, that we have to learn to see the world as we do. . . . In some sense we literally create the world we speak about.


Peter Berger and Thomas Luckman, The Social Construction of Reality (Garden
City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1966), pp.2l-22.






To put this more plainly, what you see is not the world “out there”; it is the world you created in your mind.




This quality of perception—this demand that a perception be meaningful—helps prevent our being overwhelmed by the infinite number of information fragments in our environments; it helps us select and organize the relatively small number of fragments from our mosaic that we can handle. We do the selecting and organizing in terms of the meaning those fragments have for us.

Can you think of any experience you have had that supports Young’s claims? Have you ever perceived something one way, only to discover later that your perception was totally wrong? What about some of the visual illusions? (Later in this chapter, we will provide some examples of those, in case you have not seen any.)






Set or Expectation and the Processing of Information


Our scripts are shaped not only by our ancient past (going back virtually to birth or even, some would say, into the womb), but also by our very recent past. One important effect of both recent and ancient past is to create expectations or sets, assumptions about the world in which we live. Because of your prior experience, for example, if you hear someone mumbling what sounds like “A, B, C, D,” and then something else, your expectation or set leads you to perceive that the person said “E.” That is the reality you create. Whatever was said, that part of the world in your head is an “E.” A rather simple experiment suggests one of the ways expectations are created and demonstrates their effect.




One communication scholar has studied the way a headline can affect readers’ perceptions of what a newspaper story said. He constructed two news stories for this experiment: one about a murder suspect being interrogated by the police, the other about an accelerated program of instruction being developed for a college. For each story he had three headlines, two biased in opposite ways and one neutral. For example, one headline for the murder investigation story suggested the suspect was guilty; the other suggested he was innocent. Subjects who read the story with the “guilty” headline were significantly more likely to conclude that the person was guilty than those who read the same story with the “innocent” headline. Biased headlines did not have the same effect on perceptions of the story about the accelerated college program. This was an issue in which these readers had more of a personal stake, and so they tended to read it more carefully. And, as you might expect, the study found that the more carefully a subject read a story, the less effect the headline had. Careful reading resulted in a more relevant script being evoked, rather than the irrelevant script evoked by the headline.




You may have noticed a similarity or link to the concept of scripts/schemata. Applying a script or schema creates a “set” or “expectation” of what is likely to happen next. For example, the scripts that we apply to the three shots in  The Guardian) commercial—“skinhead sees car, turns and runs,” “skinhead runs and grabs businessman,” and “skinhead saves businessman from falling bricks”—each provides dramatically different sets or expectations of what happens next.






BYLINE


Do you think your perceptions are affected by newspaper headlines? Why do you believe this is so? In the headline study, the researcher found that expectations created by headlines had less effect when people read the stories more carefully. Do most people read, listen, or view the media carefully enough to counteract the effect of expectation? Do you?






Our knowledge of and attitudes toward a newspaper or columnist, newscaster or station, or perhaps even toward the mass media in general probably act in the same way as a headline. They affect our set or expectations; hence, they affect the way we perceive the information received from those media.




The Absence of Set or Expectation: Passive Perception


The research described thus far involves the effect of expectation or set on perception. But what about your perception of material that you happen to see or hear or read for which you have no prior expectation? This may be the case when you listen to a radio or television station you have not heard before, or read a newspaper story without noticing the headline and without prior information about the event. Normally, unless you are almost totally passive during that exposure, you will quickly develop expectations based on the first bits of information you notice—the opening scene of a drama, the introductory lines of a news story, or the first bars of music. From then on, all of the effects of expectation apply.




If you remain passive during such exposure to the media, developing no expectations of what is to come, the effects are less certain. In fact, total passivity may not even be possible unless you are asleep or hypnotized or are paying no attention to the medium. Assuming such passivity is possible, it seems likely you will not understand as much of the information as you would otherwise. You will not have the aid of a relevant script that may be stored in your memory, and therefore you will not have the aid of appropriate expectations. Expectations make media content easier to grasp, as long as that content is reasonably consistent with them—as it usually is. Returning to an earlier example, when someone is reciting the alphabet in the normal order, your expectations help you “hear” and perceive accurately what is being said. If the letters are being recited in random order, you will have more trouble grasping them because you have no expectations to help. On the other hand, when a mistake is made in the normal recitation of the alphabet, you are more likely to pick it up if you have no expectations but are listening carefully.




Just as expectations that are reasonably consistent with the material you are hearing, reading, or seeing make that material easier to understand, expectations also make them easier to remember. Scripts serve not only as aids in interpreting information, but also as useful frameworks for recalling that information.




Whether you realize it or not, you are generally fairly good at predicting much of what you are exposed to—the next word, the next sound, the next turn of the plot. On the whole, these expectations help you process, comprehend, and remember the bits of information you sense from your communication mosaic. We will return to this concept of expectation when we discuss the way you use those bits of information to fill the gaps in the meanings you construct.






REVIEW


In general, expectations help us understand what we read, hear, see, or feel. These expectations can be caused by scripts based on similar experiences, by cues—such as newspaper headlines, or by the early part of the experience itself. The introduction of a book or television program affects your expectations of what is to follow.

PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS: IMPACT ON PERCEPTION


The process of perceiving—the construction of meanings from the stimuli we sense in our communication mosaics—is affected by many of our personal characteristics. To some extent, the particular stimuli we sense and the stimuli we ignore are also affected by those characteristics.




The Impact of Attitudes, Personality, and Expectations on Exposure: Variety and Consistency Theories


There are a number of explanations of why different individuals become exposed to the particular news stories, television programs, books, conversations, and other forms of communication that they do. None of these explanations is completely satisfactory, but communication scholars are hard at work attempting to improve them. In the meantime, these existing theories provide some useful insights. Variety theory and consistency theory, for example, explain why people differ in the degree to which they seek or are receptive to information and why each of us is sometimes receptive and sometimes unreceptive.




Variety theory assumes that people need a certain amount of variety or new sensations. They find such variety pleasurable. Studies show, however, that people vary considerably in the degree to which they seek such sensations. Some people almost always need them more than others do. But in addition, most of us seem to need them more at some times than at other times. This explains why all of us at times, and some of us almost constantly, seek new kinds of information and other media experiences, even when the information or experiences may conflict with what we believe.




Consistency theory, on the other hand, assumes that people need consistency among their beliefs, their attitudes, and their behaviors. If these are not consistent, a person tends to be uncomfortable. This theory is used to explain why some of us actively avoid some kinds of information. You can probably recall times when information that contradicted your attitudes or beliefs made you uncomfortable. For example, if you are very close with all members of your family, knowledge that one of them has done something dishonest can make you quite uneasy. Similarly, if you are a strong supporter of the president, negative information about him is somewhat disturbing. Or if you are a fan of your college athletic teams, any information that they have violated conference regulations can make you uncomfortable. All of us seem to feel internal pressure to avoid such discomfort. This pressure is so strong within some of us all of the time, and within most of us at least some of the time, that we tend to avoid information that might conflict with our beliefs. At the same time, and for the same reason, we are more likely to seek or pay attention to information that is consistent with our beliefs. This tendency to avoid information that is inconsistent with our beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors and to attend more to information that is consistent with them is called selective exposure.






BYLINE


Variety theory argues that people have a tendency to seek the pleasant stimulation that comes from new experiences. Consistency theory argues that people avoid information or experiences that might make their beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors inconsistent and seek those that make them consistent. These latter tendencies result in what some scholars have labeled “selective exposure.”






The combination of pressure to avoid conflict and pressure to seek sensations suggests another way to think about our media exposure. The relationship between variety-seeking and conflict-avoidance behavior is shown in Figure 2.1.




As the figure indicates, those two distinct types of motivation, if taken together, predict four different types of exposure behavior:




You can seek or be receptive to information on all sides of an issue, or
You can seek or be receptive only to information on the particular side that will support your existing point of view, so as to avoid or reduce discomfort, or
You can avoid discomfort by actively avoiding any kind of information, or
You can be a passive participant, neither actively seeking information nor actively avoiding that which you encounter.






BYLINE


Where do you fit in Figure 2.1? On such issues as war, abortion, the honesty of college sports, or the latest political campaign, do you seek information on all sides or do you attend largely to information that just supports your point of view? Do you sometimes do one and sometimes the other? Can you identify the kinds of issues or circumstances that cause you to seek information and the kinds that cause you to avoid information?






Impact on perceptions.


Just as attitudes, personality, and expectations tend to affect exposure to information, they also affect perceptions. A large number of studies and many of our personal experiences have demonstrated that most of us tend to perceive messages from the mass media or elsewhere in a way that is consistent with our beliefs and attitudes. This means that we tend to misperceive messages that are not consistent with them.




You have probably seen some of the many reruns of the television series “M*A*S*H” that have flooded the airways for a number of years. A pacifist with very strong attitudes against war is likely to perceive this series as a depiction of the senselessness and futility of war. Someone without strong feelings on the subject probably sees it simply as a comedy, with no special “message.” On the other hand, someone who believes firmly that America is always right, that it enters wars only to make the world a freer and safer place, probably sees “M*A*S*H” as a demonstration of the courage of America’s “citizen soldiers” under fire. The tendency to interpret or perceive information in a way that makes it consistent with one’s prior knowledge, attitudes, and behavior is called selective perception.






BYLINE


Think about one of the television comedies you particularly like, especially one involving some minority group. Is it possible that you misperceived this show at times because your attitudes differ from those of the program’s producers? Compare your perceptions of the program’s treatment of minority groups with the perceptions of others whose attitudes differ from yours.






A study of partisan viewing of the film of a football game has provided additional evidence of the way people’s attitudes create a set or expectation that in turn affects perception. Students from the teams’ schools who watched the film reported “seeing” twice as many rule violations committed by players from the other school as by players from their own school. Regardless of which school the viewers were from, the same phenomenon occurred; they always perceived more violations by the other side.




Two explanations for these phenomena have been suggested. The explanation accepted by most scholars is a version of the consistency theory described earlier. One way in which we avoid the discomfort caused by inconsistency is to misperceive any new information that is not consistent with our attitudes or behaviors. For example, if you are prejudiced against political liberals, and your local newspaper publishes a story that is favorable to Bernie Sanders, you can avoid inconsistency by perceiving the story as somehow damaging to Sanders, or you can discredit the newspaper, accusing it of distorting the news.




The other explanation of this effect of attitudes and expectations on perceptions is the principle of least effort. This is the theory that people perceive things in the simplest or easiest way they can, and it is easiest to perceive them in ways consistent with their prior expectations, attitudes, or beliefs. It takes more effort to perceive a message that is contrary to the way you see the world or that is different than what you expect.






BYLINE


Selective perception can be explained either by consistency theory or the principle of least effort. Consistency theory argues that all of us feel pressure to avoid discomfort by keeping our knowledge, our behaviors, and our attitudes consistent. The principle of least effort argues that we tend to perceive things in the easiest way possible, and that it is easiest to perceive things as consistent with our beliefs, attitudes, and expectations.






The Influence of Needs


The need to maintain consistency among, our attitudes, beliefs, and actions is only one class of needs. Other kinds of needs also influence our exposure and perception: the needs or drives for power, security, social esteem, and self-esteem. Individuals vary greatly in their drive to satisfy each of these needs. In addition, for each of us, some of these needs are felt more strongly at some times than at others. As a result, at times you probably actively seek information to satisfy some particular need; at other times, you attend to such information only when you happen to encounter it and perceive that it can serve your needs. In addition, you probably encounter and notice a certain amount of information that serves no apparent need.




Needs and information processing.


Your needs are also important factors in the way you process information. The probability is high that you usually process or perceive the information you encounter in a way that is relevant to the needs you feel most strongly at that moment. When you are hungry you are more likely to notice the food present in a dramatic scene in a movie than when you are not hungry. Similarly, if you dislike a character in a movie, you are more likely to interpret what that person does as showing negative attributes than if you like or admire him or her. If the character you dislike is very polite to elderly people, you are likely to see it as a sign of phoniness or showing off, whereas you will see it as a sign of thoughtfulness or good breeding in someone you like.






BYLINE


Many kinds of needs affect the way we process information: more-or-less permanent needs, such as our needs for self esteem, social esteem, security, and power, as well as momentary needs such as hunger.






Reference groups and information processing.


Just as our needs affect what we select from the communication environment, how we process or interpret that material, and what we remember of it, so too do our reference groups, the groups of individuals with whom we identify and to whom we look for guidance or reinforcement. Thus, our information processing is affected by our family, friends, and others with whom we associate or with whom we would like to associate. We interact with these groups and test our interpretations of what we read, hear, and see. As a result, our scripts are shaped by those interactions with other people, just as they are shaped to some extent by our interactions with the media.




As you know, the interpretations of our family, friends, and others who are important to us are not always consistent with each other. In these instances, we see an interesting phenomenon. When we are exposed to material in the company of our family, we process it in a way more consistent with their pattern. On the other hand, when we are exposed to the same material in the company of friends, we process it in a different way—in a way more consistent with the pattern of these friends. In a sense, we use a different script for interpreting this material, depending on our social context.






BYLINE


Try this mental experiment to test our claim about the effect of social context. Imagine watching an NC-17-rated movie with some of your college friends. Now imagine watching the same movie with your parents or a much younger sibling. Do you believe you would see the movie in the same way? Would you perceive the extremely violent or pornographic scenes the same way in the two situations? How would they probably differ?






We would predict that you would “see” quite a different movie when watching that NC-17-rated film in the company of your parents or a younger sibling than watching it in the company of friends.




Even the expectation of being with one of these groups in the near future can affect your processing of media content. For example, knowing you are soon going to be with your family, with different friends, or with one of your professors may cause you to read and process the morning newspaper in very different ways. You might be influenced by quite a different script in each of those instances.




In these ways, reference groups shape our sets or expectations for certain kinds of information. Some evidence even suggests that any audience with whom you are listening to or observing one of the mass media tends to be a type of reference group for you at the moment. That group, that audience of which you are a part, affects how you organize the information being communicated and what you remember of it.




Reference groups and opinions/behaviors.


As you probably know, those of us who study mass communication audiences rely heavily on surveys in our research. We are constantly interviewing people or sending them questionnaires. Many of these surveys include opinion or attitude questions such as “What do you think about the president’s proposal to reduce federal aid to education?” Or “What is your reaction to the proposal to raise tuition 6 percent in this college?” We ask these kinds of questions again and again and publish the results in newspapers or scholarly journals. However, some scholars have criticized such questions. They claim, with some justification, that when we ask questions of these sorts we are not simply measuring opinions; we are creating opinions. Many people we ask about the president’s proposal or the tuition proposal would not have thought about it before we asked their opinion. Therefore, they had no opinion until we asked the question. Once they are asked, though, most of them think about it and come up with an opinion. The question is, are the public opinion pollsters or the scholars who measure opinions in this way misleading themselves and the rest of us by claiming their results are meaningful?




At first glance, it might appear they are misleading, that such research is invalid. But that initial reaction is wrong. When pollsters create opinions that did not exist in some people before they were asked questions about them, these researchers are duplicating the conditions under which most, if not all, of us form our opinions. Let us explain.




We do not form opinions simply because we are exposed to some information. Just because we read or hear about a proposal from the president does not mean we form an opinion about it. In most cases, our development of an opinion depends on whether someone confronts us with a question about it, or on our anticipating that we will be talking with someone else about it. The opinion or point of view we then develop is in part a function of who the other individual is and of our relationship to him or her. Thinking about this other person in connection with the information we encountered affects the way we organize and use that information.




Thus, the opinions we developed about the federal aid proposal or the tuition increase are not solely the result of our individual analyses and beliefs. They are heavily influenced by our reference groups, especially those with whom we are interacting or expect to be interacting on the subject. Most of your opinions, whether you realize it or not, are strongly influenced by the people around you. And, thus, the opinions you develop and state when confronted with a public opinion pollster are probably reasonable approximations of the opinions you would develop when interacting with other strangers about those topics.




Another way to think about this matter is to consider each of your reference groups as a type of “audience” for you. That “audience” can affect your perceptions and your other behaviors, even when it is not present. In fact, an audience that is not present can sometimes affect you more than one that is. For example, consider a physician speaking to a lay audience about some particular health problem. She is probably constantly conscious of how her medical colleagues will view what she is saying. Thus, her remarks—and, hence, her points of view—are shaped by that absent audience.




Let us consider an example closer to home. Think about the behavior of college professors talking to an undergraduate class—perhaps the authors of this book talking to your class. The way we behave, the way we perceive information and talk about it to you, is influenced not only by that information and by you who are in this class, but also by our perceptions of our colleagues and how they would react to what we are saying. In fact, our comments on this page are influenced by at least two reference groups who will probably never see what we have written. One is that set of professional colleagues. The other is the set of friends who are strong feminists. It is the existence of this latter reference group that led us to refer to the physician in this example as “she.” This reference group has increased the probability that when we read the word “physicians” or “police officers,” we will construct in our minds an image of women as well as of men.




So be aware of the way your language, your behavior, and the way you process or perceive mass media messages are affected by the people with whom you interact. Even when absent, they affect what you think you are “seeing” and “hearing” in the mass media. When you hear people talking about the social construction of reality, it is this phenomenon to which they are referring, at least in part. Our beliefs and interpretations of information, even our definitions of words and other symbols, are influenced by the people with whom we interact. Thus, the realities we create in our minds are, to some extent, social constructions because they are influenced by our reference groups.




Some scholars believe the influence of other people on our processing of information is even more basic than we have suggested. They take the position that the reality each of us constructs from our communication mosaics is an intersubjective reality. According to this theory, people’s beliefs about the world are shaped in part by comparing them to the beliefs of other people. We constantly test our perceptions of reality as we interact with others.






BYLINE


The world in our heads is a product of the information we heard, read, and saw, that we processed, and that we then tested and refined through our interactions with other individuals, especially our reference groups. Thus, our realities are socially constructed; they are intersubjective realities.






Personality traits.


Another influence on your information processing is your personality. At least one personality trait, dogmatism, has even been defined by some social scientists in terms of the way we process information. Dogmatism is the degree to which people are unable to perceive or evaluate information independent of their prior attitudes, beliefs, and needs, the source of the information, and its context.




The more you receive, evaluate, and act on information from your environment on its own merits, uninfluenced by irrelevant information or by your attitudes, beliefs, or needs, the more open-minded you are. On the other hand, the more your reception, evaluation, and actions concerning that information are influenced by your attitudes, beliefs, and needs or by irrelevant information, the more dogmatic or closed-minded you are. For example, the more your evaluation of a disarmament plan is affected by whether the idea came from the president, Mikhail Gorbachev, or your roommate, the more closed-minded you are, according to this definition. The more your judgment of the quality of a motion picture is affected by knowing who the director was or by the judgments of your friends, the more closed-minded you are. Or the more easily you can be fooled by a visual illusion, the more closed-minded you are. Research has shown that a closed-minded person usually has extreme difficulty isolating an object or idea and evaluating or perceiving it independently of its context. Similarly, when a closed-minded individual is evaluating a newspaper column or broadcast commentary, he or she is more affected by the knowledge of its author’s identity than is the person with an open-minded belief system. The closed-minded or dogmatic individual is especially influenced by authority figures.




Dogmatic persons also have difficulty tolerating ambiguity. They have a strong tendency to categorize everything immediately. Such persons, when trying to solve problems, have difficulty thinking about them in more than one way. When they first encounter a problem, they assume it must be solved in a particular way. Even when that doesn’t work, they can’t seem to shake themselves loose from that frame of reference—that way of thinking. Consider, for example, the problem of connecting these nine dots with four straight lines:






The four straight lines must be formed without lifting pen or pencil from the paper and without retracing all or part of any line.




What do you perceive when exposed to those nine dots? You probably perceive a square, and that square becomes a frame of reference. In weighing the problem, it is difficult to even consider solutions that go outside the frame of reference—that go outside the square. Yet, you must go outside that frame of reference to solve the problem. Presumably, the individual with the closed-minded belief system will fail to do so, whereas the individual with an open-minded belief system is more likely to solve the problem by going outside the frame of reference and drawing the lines something like what is shown later in this chapter.






BYLINE


Our personalities affect the way we process information. Dogmatism, for example, affects how our perception of information is influenced by its context and source as well as by our prior attitudes, beliefs, and needs.






Your Language and Information Processing


Still another influence on the way we process or construct meanings from the material we read, see, and hear in the mass media is our language. Even when you are exposed to nonverbal material, such as a photograph, your language plays a large role in the way you process that information. Your everyday language, the language with which you are most familiar, gives you a set of categories or frames in which to “see” things.




Earlier we talked about patterns or scripts we acquire from past experiences and then use to organize and interpret new experiences. In a sense, our language serves that same function. The fact that we have the word “tree” and the word “bush” increases the probability that we will see the distinction between these different kinds of vegetation growing in our backyards. Having different words for each helps you see greater differences than you would if you had only one word to use for both.




The most famous example of this phenomenon is that described by linguist Benjamin Whorf, a pioneer in the study of the influence of language on thought. Whorf observed that Eskimos have many words for describing snow, in contrast to the single word available in English. He attributes this variety of labels to Eskimos’ greater ability to perceive small differences among various kinds of snow. English-speaking people, on the other hand, can do little more than distinguish snow from rain or sleet.




Words helps us objectify—to give meaning to the mass media material we encounter as well as to our other experiences in the world. If you had no word for homosexual, if you had never heard that word or the word “gay” or any other word that signified that particular concept, it is unlikely you would perceive that distinction among people in a motion picture or television drama. That is, you would not make the distinction between gays and heterosexuals. Without knowledge of that word or concept, you probably would interpret signs of affection between two men or between two women on the screen in quite a different way than you do now.




As Peter Berger and Thomas Luckman put it in their book, The Social Construction of Reality, symbols—primarily language—are the key elements in the creation of our realities. For each of us,




. . . the reality of everyday life appears already objectified, that is, constituted by an order of objects that have been designated as objects before my appearance on the scene. The language used in everyday life continuously provides me with the necessary objectifications and posits the order with which these make sense and within which everyday life has meaning for me… Language marks the coordinates of my life in society and fills that life with meaningful objects.




“And fills that life with meaningful objects.” That is the critical phrase. Language helps you give meaning to your experiences. If you can give something a label—if you have a word for it—it becomes meaningful. If you have no word—no label—it is less likely to have meaning, and you may have difficulty perceiving its existence.

Our language helps us make sense of our experiences: to make distinctions among elements, to organize them, and to make them meaningful.






Styles of Media Use


A scholar named Roland Barthes once talked about different styles of reading. See whether you recognize your usual style of reading among these:




The spearing method of reading: simply spearing bits from what you are reading—a bit here, a bit there—without plan or system. Many people read the newspaper this way.
The aromatic or gourmet method: savoring each idea or story as a gourmet savors a choice wine. If this is your style, you linger over a good story as though it were an especially tasty morsel, rolling it around in your mind so the experience will stay with you for a long time.
The nose-to-the-ground method: reading one word at a time, digging slowly, diligently through a story, never stepping back to consider the whole, or the way that story fits into a larger context.
The rolldown method: reading down each page as though it were on a steadily rolling teleprompter, giving everything the same amount of time and attention—the important and the unimportant, the interesting and the dull.


﻿Labels often shape the meaning of some image or experience. In a general sense, this sculpture depicts friendship and affection. But knowing that it is titled "Gay Liberation," you probably construct different and more specific meanings for it.


Barthes’s categories describe not only the various ways we read, but also the various ways we expose ourselves to all of the media. Think about your exposure to different media, including even conversations with friends. That is, think about your exposure to your communication mosaic. Are there certain times when you are a spearer—grabbing bits at random here and there? Are there other times when you are a gourmet-savoring the best of what you encounter, perhaps even looking down your nose at the “junk food” of the media world? We suspect you are sometimes a rooter, with your nose to the ground, concentrating on each blade of grass, and missing the forest or the contour of the lawn. Perhaps you study for examinations in this way, concentrating on little facts that might show up in multiple-choice questions and missing the overall idea. If you do not think about why you are studying and precisely what you are trying to get out of it, or if you do not think about the purposes for which you are using the media at any given time, yet feel pressured to learn all that you can, you probably have become a rolldown expert, taking in everything, without priority and without order.




A fifth style of media use needs to be added to those suggested by Barthes, one that could be labeled the suntan style. As you might expect, suntanners are the individuals who enjoy relaxing and letting the waves of sound from the stereo or radio, or the visual images of the television set or movie, wash over them like the rays of the sun.






BYLINE


Which of these five styles best describes your usual use of the media? Do you use different styles for different purposes?






The truly skilled users of the mass media are those persons who adapt their style of media use to their needs of the moment and to the nature of the media content with which they are dealing. Conversely, the skilled and sensitive media professionals find ways to cue us to the style they believe most appropriate for each particular media product they present. This is done in the print media, for example, with headlines, subheadings, print size, the way material is laid out on the page, and the page on which it is placed.






Effects of “chunking style” on memory.


Our styles of media use, as some of Roland Barthes’s categories suggest, are very much like our styles of eating. One of the important differences in eating style is the size of the bite. Some people eat their food quickly, in large bites; others go slowly, taking one small bite at a time. Just as our bites of food can vary in size, so our bites of information can vary in size—we can “chunk” our information in large, medium-sized, or small bites. You can see this clearly if you examine the ways different people read. Some individuals fixate on one word at a time. Others fixate on a phrase or a line at a time, chunking in larger units. Similarly, in watching a television program you can fixate upon the larger story line and not “see” some of the details of costume, set, light, and other elements, or you can fixate on these details and perhaps fail to grasp some of the program’s plot or theme. Thus, when we talk about chunking in communication, we are referring to the size of the information bits or the number of information bits you are attending to at one time.




With reading, at least, you can cover more ground—read faster—by chunking in larger units. Some experts say you also have a better chance of grasping major ideas when you chunk in larger units. However, you probably miss some of the detail—the nuances of language, particular differences in sentence construction, and so on. Which type of reading is better depends on your purpose in reading. When you are proofreading newspaper copy, for instance, you probably ought to chunk by words or, at times, even by letters. When you are reading something to see if it has information about Iraq, you probably ought to chunk by phrases or lines of type.




These differences in chunking style probably account for many students’ observation after they have taken a television or film production class that they no longer enjoy television programs or movies as much. They tend to notice the editing and the other techniques of production, and this distracts them and prevents them from enjoying the show. They have not yet learned to control their chunking behavior so it will be appropriate for their viewing purposes.




One theory of memory suggests that chunking—grouping items together to reduce the number of individual units to retain—helps us remember more material. We retain the group as a unit, rather than remembering each individual item. It seems that an editor of a newspaper or a newscast can help audience members do this by precoding for them, grouping similar or related items. The result should be better recall of the items by readers, listeners, or viewers.






BYLINE


Your style of media use affects the information you sense and, therefore, the world you construct in your head. Among the important styles of use are the size “chunks” of information you tend to grasp and whether you are using a spearing, aromatic (gourmet), nose-to-the-ground, rolldown, or suntan style.

In what sense does language "fill our lives with meaningful objects"?




Without names or labels that we can apply, objects or experiences are less likely to have meaning for us.




Anything we cannot talk about is not likely to be meaningful for us.




Language is enriching; the early cultures that had no language were intellectually poor.

VARIABLES IN THE COMMUNICATION MOSAIC


Up to this point we have been considering the way differences between you and other people, or even the differences within you over time, can affect your processing of information. We turn now to some other kinds of differences that affect your processing: variables in your communication mosaic.




Prior Exposure and the Processing of Information


When considering the role of prior exposure in information processing, a good starting place is the saying attributed to Greek philosopher Heraclitus who lived in the fifth or sixth century B.C.: “You can’t step into the same river twice.” Not only is there constant change in the river—in our case, the communication mosaic—there is also constant change in you. Each prior experience, however slight, changes you in some respect. Each bit of information that you sense affects your response to later information, especially to related, similar, or “identical” information. It appears, in other words, that repetition affects you even when you do not recall your prior exposure to the information. Support for this generalization is found in studies that show you will learn things more quickly if you have learned them before and forgotten them than if you never knew them. It is likely, then, that the second or third time you get a particular bit of information (about a kidnapping or about the president, for example)—even if you do not recall getting that information before—it has a different effect than it had the first time.




Repetition and Persuasion


One body of evidence suggests that repetition of persuasive messages—that is, hearing a persuasive message such as a political commercial more than once—causes people to agree more rapidly with the statement of opinion. Repetition has also been shown to affect choice of a product. However, we do not know whether a commercial can be played too often, whether there is a point of diminishing returns—or even a reversal—after a certain amount of repetition. Nor do we know much about the effect of short or long time periods between repetitions of the message, although some evidence suggests that a broadcast commercial is more effective if it comes in bursts rather than being evenly distributed over a long period of time. Thus, if you are going to run for political office and can afford an average of only one commercial a day throughout the campaign period, you are probably wiser to schedule seven commercials on one day each week, instead of running just one commercial every day.




Repetition can also occur across as well as within media. Thus you can boost your political candidacy by transmitting your name or campaign slogan through a variety of media so voters will likely encounter it repeatedly, not only when they listen to the radio but also when they turn from radio to the newspaper, when they pass some billboards, when they see people sporting political buttons, and so on.




With enough repetition, even mere exposure, with no apparent attempt at persuasion, seems to affect attitude. For example, one study showed that the more frequently subjects were exposed to some Chinese symbols whose meanings they did not know, the more likely they were to believe that the symbols represented something “good.” This suggests that just showing minority group members in advertisements so that the audience is exposed to them frequently may have a positive effect on attitudes toward these groups, at least among children who have no preconceived notions about these groups.






REVIEW


Repeated exposure to information tends to aid learning and positive attitude change, at least up to a point. We do not know when repetition might boomerang, or what is the ideal time period between repetitions.






Gaps and the Processing of Information


In 1890, William James, an American psychologist and philosopher, discussed the fact that many gaps exist in the information we receive and that the degree to which we can fill those gaps varies widely among individuals:




When we listen to a person speaking or read a page of print, much of what we think we see or hear is supplied from memory. We overlook misprints, imagining the right letters, though we see the wrong ones; and how little we actually hear, when we listen to speech, we realize when we go to a foreign theatre; for there what troubles us is not so much that we cannot understand what the actors say as that we cannot hear their words. The fact is that we hear quite as little under similar conditions at home, only our mind, being fuller of English verbal associations, supplies the requisite material for comprehension upon a much slighter auditory hint.




Ample evidence suggests that James’ generalization is valid, and that the extent and ways we fill the gaps depend in good part on the kinds of scripts or schemata we have stored in memory, as discussed in the first part of this chapter.






In the example above the visual information can either reinforce what we “hear,” or it can change it. This visual overrides audio phenomenon is called the “McGurk Effect.”




Solution to the nine-dot problem.


The problem of connecting the nine dots, described earlier, is not only an example of the way one’s personality and frame of reference can affect perception, it is also a good analogy for the many gaps we find in the body of information we get from the media and the ways we tend to fill them. The shape of those nine dots was familiar to anyone raised in a western culture; it immediately brought to mind a square, a concept for which you have a well-established script in your memory. Therefore, you probably tried to close the gaps among those dots by completing the square. However, if you did, you found it impossible to do so without lifting your pen or pencil from the paper and without retracing any lines. As you see in the solution below, you needed to go outside the frame of reference of the square and form a totally different shape in order to close the gaps without violating the conditions. In this case, your “square” script or schema interfered with effective processing of that problem.






Gaps in the information we sense from the media.


As suggested in Chapter 1, there are many gaps or missing pieces in the array of information we get from the media. We read about one political candidate answering the charges of an opponent, but we miss the opponent’s original charges. We do not get enough information about political candidates, or persons charged with crimes, or characters in soap operas or other dramas, to know for certain what their motivations are. We hear charges about some large industries ruining the air and streams and, at the same time, charges that pollution is far less serious than the damage that overregulation is doing to the American economy, but we do not get enough facts to know for certain where “truth” lies. When it comes to foreign affairs, the bits of information we get are even more scattered and, hence, the gaps far greater.




In spite of these gaps, in spite of the incomplete information we sense from our communication mosaics, the worlds we create in our heads are whole. When we must think about or act on any of these matters, we think about or act on a complete picture. In judging the political candidate’s response to charges, we infer what those charges are on the basis of a “political” script we have in our heads. Often without realizing it, we create motivations for the candidates and characters. We “know” whether industry leaders or the environmentalists are right in their debate because we fill in the scenario from another script we have stored away.






REVIEW


We have a natural tendency to fill all gaps in messages. We tend to create “whole pictures” from the bits of information to which we are exposed.








The Effect of lconicity on the Processing of Information


Iconicity is the degree to which a symbol is similar to that which it represents. The family photograph you managed to shoot with reasonably sharp focus is a good example of a highly iconic image. At the opposite end of the dimension of iconicity is the arbitrary symbol, such as the word family, or a group of stones an artist might arrange to represent a family or—even less iconic—to represent humanity. Theorists label this end of the continuum “non-iconic,” “symbolic,” or “abstract.”




The importance of iconicity for our present purposes is that the more iconic or realistic a stimulus, according to theorists, the more specific the referent with which receivers will associate it; the less realistic a stimulus—the more abstract it is—the more general the referent with which it will be associated. For example, according to the theory, you are more likely to perceive an abstract drawing of an athlete than a realistic photograph of an athlete as a symbol for all athletes, for athletics in general, or for health and physical fitness. On the other hand, you are more likely to associate the realistic photograph with a particular athlete rather than generalizing it.




An understanding of this theory is important for you both as a receiver and processor of information and as a potential creator of films or other media messages. It can help explain why you sometimes perceive that a drama or a photograph is not just about the particular individuals or things being portrayed but that it has far wider implications. Knowing about this theory can also help you recognize how photographers or directors want you to interpret their work.




When you are on the other side of the camera or computer, creating rather than receiving messages, this theory should help you do the things that will increase the probability your audience will interpret your creations as you want them to. The more realistic you make a description or representation of a person or object, the more the audience is likely to interpret it as a specific person or thing. The more abstract you make it, the more they are likely to generalize it to some more general class of persons or objects, or even to some abstract idea such as “evil” or “love.”






REVIEW


The more iconic an image, the more specific the referent or meaning receivers tend to construct for it. The less iconic the image that is, the more abstract—the more general the meaning or referent constructed.






Order of exposure to the communication mosaic.


An ample body of evidence suggests that the order in which you get bits of information affects what you recall and what you think about what you recall. In the short run, there appears to be both a primacy effect and a recency effect. In general, the bits of information you remember best and that have most influence on your attitudes and meaning constructions are those you receive first (the primacy effect) and those you receive last (the recency effect). For example, if you hear a series of stories or read a large number of facts within a relatively brief period, you will tend to remember best the earliest and latest ones.




This generalization has been tested in a variety of ways. For example, in one study researchers had subjects listen to radio newscasts and rotated the order of news items for different test audiences (in order to counterbalance any effects due to variations in interest value of stories). A relationship, shown in Figure 2.2 was found between recall and the order of presentation.






For many issues about which we get information from the mass media and elsewhere, we encounter arguments on different sides. We encounter some arguments to vote for a bond issue for a community center and some arguments to vote against it. Or we receive bits of information that give us different impressions of a person, object, or idea—for example, contradictory information about the personality of a political figure or about the dangers of a nuclear power plant. Whether we are more affected relatively by the arguments we encounter first or by those we encounter last depends on a number of factors:




When we are not particularly interested in the issue and have no opinion about it, we tend to be more influenced by the information we receive first. In one study that demonstrated this phenomenon, subjects were exposed to two descriptions of the behavior of someone called “Jim.” One description showed Jim as an extrovert and one as an introvert. The impressions of Jim that subjects had afterward were influenced primarily by the description to which they were exposed first.




When we are highly interested in an issue, when we have a strong need to know or understand (what some scholars term a high need for cognition), the order in which information is received makes little difference.
When we expect someone is trying to influence us, the impact of the initial bits of information to which we are exposed is reduced. The same occurs when we expect to get information on various sides of the issue and, therefore, are aware we should avoid early judgment.
If we become involved in a conversation about the issue and take a position based on the information received up to that time, the ultimate effect of that early information is increased. Our taking a position, even in casual conversation, seems to commit us to that view. In addition, the more “public” that commitment, the greater its influence.
Time and the distraction caused by other activities in the intervals between bits of information increase the probability that the most recent information to which we have been exposed will have the greatest influence on our perceptions of the message.




REVIEW


Primacy and recency effects are strongest when we have no interest in or opinion on a topic. Primacy and recency effects are weakest when we have a high need for cognition or are suspicious that someone is trying to influence us. The greater the time or distraction between the early and late information, the greater will be the influence of the latter.






The Effect of Context on the Processing of Information


The final stimulus variable to consider is context. All sorts of contextual variables affect the meaning or reality we perceive. The kind of drama in which a particular scene is embedded can affect the interpretation of the scene. The other stories on the front page of the newspaper can affect the way each individual story is perceived. This phenomenon is seen most easily in visual illusions such as Figure 2.3.






You can see how context alters our perception of the relative sizes of the cylinders. The combination of context and placement of the figures on the right side of the illustration causes us to perceive all three cylinders as roughly the same size. The combination of context and placement on the left causes us to perceive far greater differences in size among the cylinders than actually exist. Similarly, a label or word can sometimes so structure a message for some people that parts of it are effectively blocked out. For instance, if we label a message as a “commercial” or as “persuasive,” that context reduces its persuasibility. Precisely the same story about a political candidate will be perceived differently when it is run during the break in an entertainment program and labeled a political commercial than when it is embedded in a television newscast as one of the regular news stories.

Consider the relationship between commercials and programs you have seen on television. Do you see ways exposure to some commercials can affect people’s perceptions of the program—for example, of some news stories or of a movie in which commercials are inserted? Do you see ways exposure to a program can alter perception of a commercial?






Composition as context.


The composition of a photograph or of words or letters on a page provides a different type of context. But it is a context that can also have a strong impact on our constructions of meaning. You are probably quite familiar with the way photographic composition can alter meaning: camera angle, type of lens, closeness of camera to subject, and so forth. We suspect, though, that you probably never thought about the fact that the composition of printed matter can also affect meaning.




One of America’s most imaginative poets, E. E. Cummings, clearly thought about it and used it in his work. In “a leaf falls,” which is probably his most delicate and beautiful poem, he uses both composition and the juxtaposition of words to stimulate readers to construct a variety of fresh meanings. This poem consists simply of the phrase “a leaf falls” and the word “loneliness” intertwined and arranged on the page in an unusual, falling order. This is the poem:




l(a


le


af


fa


ll


s)


one


l


iness




We mentioned earlier the fact that audience members are far more than simply receivers; they are full participants in the process of communication. Nowhere is that fact clearer than in the case of this poem. The context that each of the ideas in this poem provides for the other and the context of the composition interact with the ideas readers bring to the work—including ideas about loneliness, about falling leaves, about poetry, and about novelty. From this interaction, each reader constructs a meaning.




Impact of contextual cues on attributions.


Contextual cues can also affect whether we perceive something in the media as “natural” or “symbolic” and, therefore, in need of interpretation. And if we think it is symbolic, contextual cues can influence the meaning or intent we attribute to the symbol’s creator.




For example, a piece of torn window screen shown in a television drama will be perceived as “natural” if it appears in a brief shot of an old, abandoned house. On the other hand, if we see it during the titles of the show, isolated from the window, with a strong spotlight shining on it, we will almost certainly perceive it as “symbolic,” and we will try to figure out what the director was trying to communicate by that symbol.




We perceive a set of random words as a “natural” error by a typist or editor if we see them on the pages of a newspaper or coming over the wire service, but we will probably perceive them as “symbolic” if we encounter the same set of random words in a book of poetry or the arts section of the newspaper. If those random words are arranged in “stanzas,” the perception of them as poetry will be almost certain, and we will work hard to figure out what that odd poem means.




Creators of most kinds of media content, from movies to news stories and from television programs to novels, use contextual cues to help you perceive what to interpret as symbolic and what to interpret as natural. To understand the creator’s intent, you need to become sensitive to these cues.






BYLINE


Think about the movies or television programs you have seen recently or the novels you have read. Do you think any of them, or characters in them, were symbols for something else or for some class of individuals? What in the film, the program, or the novel led you to perceive it in this way?






Context as a figure-ground phenomenon.


One way to think of context is in terms of the figure-ground phenomenon. This contextual phenomenon is similar to what occurs with any type of perception: when you focus on one pattern, the rest becomes background. A familiar optical illusion, shown in Figure 2.4, demonstrates this phenomenon.






This illusion is called the Peter-Paul goblet. When first looking at the figure, some people will see a goblet; others will see two faces. You can see both of them if you try, but not at one time. At any moment you can perceive either the goblet or the faces, and the other part of the drawing becomes background. When you see the faces, the goblet is background; when you see the goblet, the faces are background. You can focus on only one at a time. Thus, in your communication mosaic, you might focus on all of the fragments that have a conceivable relationship to the economy, and everything else becomes ground—foreign policy, politics, and so on. Once you find a particular theme of this sort—just as you find a pattern in visual perception—you tend to keep on perceiving that theme. The theme could be that young people are going to hell, that the capitalists dominate everything, or that God controls our actions and our fate. Given any one of these themes as the figure, you would perceive quite a different world in the messages in your environment than if any other theme was the figure.






REVIEW


The context in which we hear, read, or see something affects the meaning we create for that message and its influence on us. The context of a stimulus can influence whether we perceive it as a symbol or as some natural phenomenon. The context may even be part of the world in our heads, a theme we treat as the frame of reference for something we are reading, seeing, or hearing.

THE PROCESSING OF NEWS VERSUS ENTERTAINMENT


If you have a special interest in literature, you may be aware of the debate going on today in literary circles concerning what is and is not fiction, or what is and is not literature. For example, consider Truman Capote’s book In Cold Blood, based on the actual murder of a family and the men who did it. In gathering the material for his book, Capote studied all of the news accounts of the brutal and senseless affair and interviewed the murderers, friends and relatives of the murdered family, and others who were involved in the trial. But in addition to descriptions of actual events and people, he added conversations that may or may not have taken place and additional events to aid the flow of the story. Which parts of the book are journalistic or historical description and which are fiction is unclear and probably was unclear even to Capote.




Critics have argued whether this and similar books comprise a new literary genre, or whether they are simply part of a continuum on which every piece of literature lies. In a sense, every work of fiction contains some germ of fact. No writer can make a story out of nothing; he or she must build on experience with people and events. Thus, every story is some blend of fact and fiction.




Some literary theorists have gone even further. Just as any novel can be read, in some sense, as a description of reality, any piece of writing that purports to be a description of reality, for example, a work of history, can be read as fiction. It is impossible to truly recreate the past. All a historian can do is tell a story that is an analogy or model of the past. In the same way, news stories are, to some extent, fiction—selective interpretations of events as filtered through the eyes and camera angles and words of observers, journalists, and editors and molded into coherent stories.




Just as many contemporary literary critics and theorists are trying to break down the boundaries between literature and nonliterature, so are critics and theorists of mass communication beginning to break down the boundary between news and entertainment. When one considers that most news or information is almost immediately used in entertainment, this breakdown seems essential. The latest news event becomes, almost overnight, part of the plot of soap operas, made-for-television movies, and situation comedies.




For example, consider the popular “true crime” genre. Podcasts like Serial or docuseries like Making a Murderer present factual events but use narrative storytelling techniques—like cliffhangers, character development, and carefully selected interviews—to shape a specific, often dramatic, interpretation of reality.




This incorporation of nonentertainment into entertainment has been going on since the beginnings of literature and drama. The Greek dramas and the early religious dramas were attempts to communicate moral lessons and the events of the day in more interesting and effective ways. The songs of wandering minstrels centuries ago were essentially news stories set to music. The extreme of this confounding of literature and nonliterature can be seen in the work of a poet some years ago who found a unique source for his creations. His “poems” consisted of classified advertisements, unchanged except for the arrangement of the lines.




So when we see a motion picture about the latest million-dollar robbery or the latest war, is it any less “real” than the newspaper or television news account of the event? Both are selective. Both are translations of the event into words and pictures. The only difference is that one claims to be news and the other claims to be fiction or entertainment or, sometimes, docudrama—a blend of documentary and dramatization. In fact, the news story, like the dramatization, is both news and fiction; neither can possibly be anything else.






BYLINE


Instances have been documented of a television network having people restage news occurrences so they could be videotaped for broadcast on news programs. Is this practice consistent with responsible journalism? What about docudramas? Why might one consider the creation of docudramas ethical but the recreation of news events for broadcast on news programs unethical?






Looking at the reverse side of this coin, we can see that the news and informational or educational materials presented through the media also incorporate elements of fiction or entertainment. When we report in the newspaper or newscast about a city council meeting, a women’s basketball game, or the latest doings of the student senate, how do we shape that material? We shape it into a “story”—a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end—a story with a plot and, if we are clever enough, a story with a villain and a hero or heroine.




It is interesting, by the way, that as our news stories and documentaries take on more and more the form of traditional fiction, much of fiction is taking on more and more the form—or formlessness—of events out in the world, without beginning, middle, or end; without heroes, heroines, or villains; without logical order. At its most extreme, this form of literature gives us an almost random set of bits of information from which each reader creates his or her own story.




The point of all this—the effect of all of these phenomena—is that just as the boundaries between news and entertainment have broken down in good part for the creators of those forms of mass communication, so have they broken down for the consumers of those forms: for you and us as the audience. In fact, for us consumers, they may have broken down even more. We probably can make no meaningful distinction between them in their impact on the creation of our realities. Entertainment can shape that world in our heads—our images of reality—as much as news can; at times it can shape it even more.




Chernobyl (2019)
An HBO 2019 historical  miniseries that revolves around the Chernobyl disaster of 1986 and the cleanup efforts that followed.


The HBO miniseries contains several significant historical and technological inaccuracies and dramatizations. Here are some notable falsehoods and exaggerations, drawn from expert analysis and historical sources:




Radiation Effects and Medical Portrayals — The series shows people suffering visible radiation burns within minutes or hours of exposure, and children in hospitals with acute radiation syndrome (ARS). In reality, ARS symptoms like burns take days or weeks to appear, and only plant workers and first responders developed ARS—none of the public, including children in Pripyat, suffered from it. Also, the depiction that a pregnant woman’s baby “absorbed” radiation to save her life is medically impossible and has no basis in radiobiology.
The “Bridge of Death” — The show claims that everyone who watched the explosion from a railway bridge in Pripyat died soon after. This widely repeated story is considered an urban legend; there is no evidence that all these spectators died as a direct result of radiation exposure.
The Helicopter Crash — The series depicts a helicopter crashing into the reactor within days of the explosion due to radiation. In reality, a helicopter did crash, but it happened months later (October 1986), and the cause was striking a crane cable, not radiation.
The Threat of a “Nuclear Bomb” or Megaton Explosion — The show suggests a potential secondary explosion of 2–4 megatons that could have rendered much of Europe uninhabitable. This is physically impossible; a nuclear reactor cannot explode like a nuclear bomb, and the scenario described in the show is an exaggeration.
The Fate of the “Suicide Squad” — The drama implies the three men who drained the bubbler tanks beneath the reactor died soon after from radiation. In reality, all three survived the mission and lived for years afterward.
Soviet Threats and Executions — The show frequently depicts Soviet officials threatening summary executions to enforce orders. In reality, such threats were not common in the Soviet Union by the 1980s, and there is no evidence of anyone being threatened with execution during the Chernobyl response.
The Character of Ulana Khomyuk — The scientist Ulana Khomyuk is a fictional composite, not a real person. She was invented to represent the efforts of many Soviet scientists.
Legasov’s Role and Public Testimony — The series shows Valery Legasov testifying dramatically at the trial and openly challenging the Soviet system. In reality, Legasov was not present at the trial, and such open criticism would have been highly unlikely in a Soviet court.
Reactor Operation and Staff Awareness — The show portrays staff as knowingly violating safety rules and being aware of the reactor’s instability. In reality, many of the actions taken were within standard procedures for the test, and the operators did not realize the reactor was critically unstable due to poor instrumentation and training.
The “Heroic Scientists Uncovering the Truth” Trope — The narrative of scientists heroically uncovering the truth about the reactor design flaws is exaggerated. Many Soviet nuclear specialists were already aware of these issues before the accident, and the cause was quickly identified by experts after the disaster.




REVIEW


There is far less difference between news reports and many forms of entertainment than most people realize. Both contain elements of fact and fiction and both can be “read” as either fact or fiction.






The docudrama is a unique phenomenon in television; it is the only time we get a mix of fact and fiction in one program.

The authors of your text argue that the boundaries between fact and fiction, or news and entertainment, have broken down so that the news we get is almost always, in some sense, partly fiction, while fiction is, in some sense, partly fact, or even news. What is the most important implication of this for the world you construct in your head?




We cannot trust the news media to help us construct our views of the world.




We may not be able to make valid generalizations about reality from that world in our head.




We get important bits of information for that world from the fiction and entertainment to which we are exposed, as well as from news and so-called informational media.




The influence of the news media on that world in our heads is decreasing.


WHY ALL OF THESE FACTORS AFFECT OUR INFORMATION PROCESSING


Why do all of the effects discussed in this chapter occur? At least part of the reason is that each of us is faced with far more information than we can take in and process in a rational way. We can cope with only a small part of that information and must make inferences about much of the rest; we must fill the gaps left by what we skimmed over or simply missed. We do this in part by anticipating what the information will be. We anticipate the future in the only way we can: through inference based on prior experience. Then, when the future becomes the present—or the past—we have some check on our inference; either it worked or it didn’t work. The results of this test affect the kind of inference we make in the future—our expectation.




These unconscious processes of perception are much like the processes a scientist goes through consciously. Each time we perceive something in our communication environment, it is as though we are experimentally testing a hypothesis about what that thing is. Our hypothesis—or expectation—is then confirmed and reinforced or disconfirmed and modified according to the results of the test. For example, from the fragments of sports news that we accept from the media, we make an inference about whether it will be worthwhile to buy a season ticket for the football games. Our experiences in the stadium serve to confirm or deny the inference. That confirmation or lack of confirmation, in turn, affects the way we perceive or make inferences from future sports news we encounter.




Many scholars today talk about information overload, by which they mean the constant exposure to more information than individuals can process. These scholars assume that, because of all of the new communications technologies, the amount of information overload is far greater than it has ever been in the past. We believe that assumption is wrong. Information overload is not the result of the increasing amounts of processed information coming at us from the mass media. Those who claim it is, fail to consider the fact that not all of our information comes from the media and, even more important, that we have always had communication overload—more stimuli or fragments of information available to each of us than we can handle. Just look out of the window and try to notice every single thing. Obviously, that is an impossible task, for there are almost an infinite number of minute fragments in that scene. An examination of one of your hands may provide a clearer example. Under normal circumstances, we perceive little more than its grossest characteristics. A careful examination, however, shows that we could study one of our hands for a long time and still not see all that is there. Look at the myriad lines, various colors, hairs, and interesting shapes. And each finger is unique. The hand contains far more information than we can absorb. But normally we do not even try to absorb all of it; there is no need to do so. We abstract what we need and ignore the rest. This is precisely what we do when we process information we receive from the mass media.






REVIEW


Many of the unconscious processes of perception—such as chunking or filling gaps in the array of information to which we are exposed—occur because most of us are confronted with more information than we can handle easily. These processes help us cope with this information overload.






Human perception has always had to deal with "information overload," it is NOT a new phenomenon caused by so many new forms of media communication.

In what sense are our perception processes like the processes of a scientist?




Both are based on models.




We constantly test the validity of our perceptions, like a scientist testing hypotheses, and then adjust them when they are not confirmed.




We begin with a theory of what the world is like, test that theory by observing the world, and then refine the theory.




Through our perception processes we are always trying to understand the world, just as scientists, in their various ways, are trying to understand the world.

YOUR COMMUNICATION MOSAIC: SUMMARY & IMPLICATIONS


The mosaic model gives us not simply a different way of thinking about communication, but a different definition of communication. Since meaning is not in words or pictures, objects or actions, but rather in people, communication is something that takes place when a person constructs meanings from words, pictures, objects, or actions that have symbolic value for him or her.




Thus, it is not the sender who is in control of whether communication takes place; it is the audience members whom that message hits who are in control. So it makes good sense to think of those audience members—those meaning constructors—as participants in the communication process, not simply as receivers.




Another implication of the mosaic model is that you are mistaken if you believe you take in or consume media content in rather large and well organized segments—for example, that you watch and take into your memory system programs, newspaper stories, movies, or books. In fact, you never take into your memory bank an entire program, news story, movie, or book. You take in bits of information and you construct those larger entities in your head. And because no two persons exposed to the same movie, for example, ever take in precisely the same bits of information, the world you construct in your head of the movies you see, or of anything else, is bound to be at least somewhat different than the worlds constructed by everyone else. And each of the movies, television programs, newspaper stories, books, and other such images you have constructed in your head becomes a building block for larger messages—messages about the television industry, the field of journalism, politics, intercollegiate athletics, the military, the abortion issue, war, and so forth.




If you think about the image of politics that you have in your head, or your image of intercollegiate athletics, and about how you came to have that image, you should begin to understand better the mosaic concept. You must have constructed that image over a long period of time from many different bits of information that you encountered in a variety of media, interpersonal communication, and perhaps even first-hand experiences.




Here are some of the major points that may help you to understand and remember the concept of the communication mosaic:




Each of us lives in four worlds: the vast universe or world that is largely beyond our view; that world or mosaic of information that is available to us if we search for or attend to it; that world to which we are exposed; and that world in our heads we construct.
It is useful to think of the second, third, and fourth of those worlds as mosaics of information bits.
Each of these mosaics is an interpretation and representation of that first world.
From the large mosaic that is your environment (your second world), you select or are exposed to many bits of information (your third world).
You interpret those bits to which you are exposed and use them to construct your reality, the world in your head (your fourth world).


Another major point of this chapter is that the perception or understanding of your communication environment is a creative process in which you are engaged throughout all of the waking hours of your lifetime. We looked at the major factors that affect that creative process—that affect the way you construct and constantly reconstruct all of the meanings that fill the world in your head.




We talked about two major sets of factors that affect the way you process information. One set is composed of all of your personal qualities and habits that influence the way you see your environment. Central to these personal characteristics are the patterns we called “scripts” or “schemata” that you built up over the years. These scripts were shaped by your particular experiences, knowledge, needs, values, and beliefs. You match incoming stimuli against these scripts and use what seems to be the most relevant script to organize, fill in, and make sense of each set of stimuli. These scripts are not static; they are constantly evolving as you encounter new information and as you test their validity. It does not take much interaction with other people for you to learn which of your interpretations of information from your communication mosaic are sharply inconsistent with the interpretations of others. A friend might have said to you, “You thought that movie was a comedy? You certainly didn’t see the same movie I did.” Such reactions can bring a sharp change in the script you use to assess that sort of movie in the future.




Another major function of a script is to shape your expectation or set, making it easier to process and to remember information. Your needs, attitudes, and beliefs also affect your expectations in such a way that you are more likely to perceive and remember messages that are consistent with them; you are less likely to perceive or remember messages that are inconsistent with them.




People who are close to you—family members, friends, others with whom you identify—also affect the set with which you approach the media, how you process information you encounter, and what you remember of that information. These people are your reference groups. Just being in the company of one of these reference groups when you are being exposed to a television program, movie, or some other media content, or just being aware that you soon will be in their company, can affect what you see in that content and what you bring away from that experience. Reference groups affect you in this way because each one’s presence or expected presence tends to activate a different script. In addition, each of your reference groups is a type of audience for you. And the kinds of ideas you are likely to extract or construct from your media experiences for one of these audiences (such as your friends) is often quite different from the kinds you are likely to construct for another of these audiences (such as your parents).




Another major factor in the way you process information from your communication mosaic is your language. That language influences the kinds of things you see and the kinds of distinctions you make. Words are necessary tools for making sense of your environment.




Your construction of the world in your head is influenced not only by your personal characteristics or internal environment, but also by the characteristics of the information you encounter in your external environment. Among the many characteristics of that information is its redundancy or repetitiveness. The more often you encounter information; the greater influence it tends to have on you. Similarly, the order in which you receive bits of information affects both which ones you are likely to recall and which ones you are more likely to believe. However, as we saw in this chapter, the effect of order varies with circumstances.




Although it may seem odd to you to call the absence of information a characteristic of messages, that is precisely what a gap is. As we noted, no message is complete; every message has gaps that its recipient must fill in. Here again, the scripts we have stored in memory play an important role in determining how those gaps are filled.




Another interesting characteristic of the messages we encounter in our communication mosaics is their relative iconicity or, at the opposite extreme, their symbolic value. We noted that the less iconic a message or stimulus, the more likely most receivers are to perceive a general rather than a specific referent. For example, we are more likely to think of all mankind or humanity when we see a highly abstract drawing of a man than when we see a realistic photograph of a particular male.




The last major characteristic of messages that we discussed was their context. Context affects the interpretation of information in a great variety of ways. For example, it can increase the probability that you will perceive a stimulus as a symbol, rather than as something standing only for itself.




In characterizing mass media messages, the distinction between “entertainment” and “information” or “news” is often considered highly important. If we think of the effects of these two forms, and the way they appear to blend into each other in our contemporary media environment, the distinction between them may not be nearly as important as many of us believed. People get a great deal of useful information from what we generally label entertainment and find much entertainment in what we label news.




In explaining the various effects of both our internal characteristics and the characteristics of our external communication environment, we suggested that we perceive or process information much the way scientists explore the world. Our scripts provide hypotheses about how to interpret information, and we test those hypotheses as we interact with other people and as we respond in other ways. In the process, we discover that some of our hypotheses work and some do not. As a result, we either reinforce those scripts in our head or revise them, and continue our eternal journey of exploration through our communication mosaics.
